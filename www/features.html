<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Features</h1>
<p>MapGuide Open Source is a web-based platform that enables users to quickly develop and deploy web mapping applications and geospatial web services.</p>
<h3>Interactive Map Viewing</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>AJAX Viewer or DWF Viewer with a common user interface and JavaScript based API  </li>
  <li>Tiled map display featuring smooth pan and zoom (AJAX Viewer only)</li>
  <li>Feature selection by point, rectangle, radius, or polygon with immediate feedback</li>
  <li>Multi-line tooltip display of feature properties</li>
  <li>Property browser provides immediate display of the properties of a selected 
    feature</li>
  <li>Support for feature buffering, query of  features that fall within  selected polygon features, and the ability to measuring distance</li>
  <li>Printing and plotting support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality Cartographic Output</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Scale dependent detail</li>
  <li>Rule driven thematic layer stylization</li>
  <li>Dyanmic labeling with overpost detection, labels that follow the path of a line, and automatic label resizing</li>
  <li>Anti-aliased image rendering </li>
  <li>True color support</li>
  <li>TrueType font support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Built-in Resource Database</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Provides hierarchical storage of XML resource documents that define maps, layers, data connections, symbology, and viewer layout </li>
  <li>Allows reuse of resources, e.g. define data sources and layers once then reference them from multiple maps </li>
  <li>Access based security model with inheritable permissions</li>
  <li>Permits meta-data and binary data to be associated with resource documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uniform Data Access</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Exclusive use of the <a href="http://fdo.osgeo.org" target="_blank">Feature Data Objects</a> (FDO) API for vector and raster feature data access
    <ul type="disc">
	  <li>Support for ESRI SHP and SDF (available now)</li>
	  <li>Support for ESRI ArcSDE, MySQL, ODBC, GDAL Raster, WMS, and WFS (coming soon)</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exclusive use of DWF for CAD based data access </li>
</ul>

<h3>Flexible Application Development</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Write your application logic within the web server environment to work with either viewer on any client </li>
 <li>Support for application development in  PHP, .NET, or Java </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensive Server-Side APIs</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Create, query, read, and write permanant and session based XML resource documents </li>
  <li>Feature data query and update across all supported data sources, including spatial and attribute query support, and schema discovery  </li>
  <li>Coordinate system factory, definitions, coordinate reprojection, and great circle distance computation  </li>
  <li>Geometry creation, manipulation, and analysis with support for spatial predicates based on the DE-9IM model, overlay functions (intersection, union, difference, symetric difference), buffer, convex hull, area, and distance functions</li>
  <li>Vector and raster map stylization and rendering  </li>
  <li>Runtime map and layer manipulation, add / remove / change layers, change layer and group visibility, modify the definition of a layer, and alter the current view </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fast, Scalable, and Secure Server Platform</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Fully multi-threaded and takes advantage of multi-core / multi-processor technology </li>
  <li>Multiple servers can be confugured as one logical site to improve scalability</li>
  <li>FastCGI based Map Agent loads once and stays loaded for use with both Apache and Microsoft IIS </li>
  <li>Database connections are pooled and shared between users,  improving performance</li>
  <li>Tile caching ensures map image tiles are only rendered once for the AJAX Viewer no matter how many users are viewing the map</li>
  <li>Connection-oriented, role-based security</li>
  <li>Configurable logging of client access, administrative access, authentication attempts, errors, session lifetimes, and request tracing</li>
  <li>Web-based site administration allows remote site and server configuration, and log file access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Broad Platform Support</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Server can be deployed on Microsoft Windows or  Linux </li>
  <li>Supports  Apache  on Windows or Linux, and IIS on Microsoft Windows</li>
  <li>Web browser support for Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and 
    Safari</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support for <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> Standards</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Web Map Service</li>
  <li>Web Feature Service</li>
</ul>
