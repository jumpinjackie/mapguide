<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Features</h1>
<p>MapGuide Open Source is a web-based platform that enables users to quickly develop and deploy web mapping applications and geospatial web services.</p>
<h3>Interactive Map Viewing</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Offers an AJAX Viewer (pure DHTML no plug-in required) or a  vector-based DWF Viewer (requires an ActiveX Control) with a common user interface and JavaScript API  </li>
  <li>AJAX Viewer offers a tiled map display for smooth navigation </li>
  <li>Allows feature selection by point, rectangle, radius, or polygon with immediate feedback</li>
  <li>Displays feature properties in multi-line tool tips</li>
  <li>Displays properties of the selected feature in a property browser panel </li>
  <li>Supports feature buffering, querying  features that fall within  selected polygons, and a tool for measuring distance</li>
  <li>Provides printing and plotting support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality Cartographic Output</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Scale-dependent detail</li>
  <li>Rule-driven thematic layer stylization</li>
  <li>Dynamic labeling with overpost detection, labels that follow the path of a line, and automatic label resizing</li>
  <li>Anti-aliased image rendering </li>
  <li>True color support</li>
  <li>TrueType font support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Built-in Resource Database for Manageability </h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Provides hierarchical storage of XML resource documents that define maps, layers, data connections, symbology, and viewer layout </li>
  <li>Allows you to define data sources and layers once and then reference them from multiple maps </li>
  <li>Provides an access-based security model with inheritable permissions</li>
  <li>Permits metadata and binary data to be associated with resource documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uniform Data Access</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Exclusive use of the <a href="http://fdo.osgeo.org" target="_blank">Feature Data Objects</a> (FDO) API for vector and raster feature data access
    <ul type="disc">
	  <li>Support for ESRI SHP and SDF (available now)</li>
	  <li>Support for ESRI ArcSDE, MySQL, ODBC, GDAL Raster, WMS, and WFS (coming soon)</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exclusive use of DWF for CAD-based data access </li>
</ul>

<h3>Flexible Application Development</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Write your application logic once within the web server environment and it will work with either viewer on any client </li>
  <li>Develop your applications in  PHP, .NET, or Java </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensive Server-Side APIs</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Create, query, read, and write permanent and session based XML resource documents </li>
  <li>Query and update feature data across all supported data sources, including spatial and attribute data, and schema discovery  </li>
  <li>Perform coordinate reprojection and great circle distance computation  </li>
  <li>Create, manipulate, and analyze geometry with support for spatial predicates based on the DE-9IM model, overlay functions (intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference), buffer, convex hull, area, and distance functions</li>
  <li>Produce stylized vector and raster maps and legends </li>
  <li>Manipulate runtime maps and layers, add / remove / change layers, change layer and group visibility, modify the definition of a layer, and alter the current view </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fast, Scalable,  Secure Server Platform</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Fully multi-threaded and takes advantage of multi-core / multi-processor technology </li>
  <li>Multiple servers can be configured as one logical site to improve scalability</li>
  <li>FastCGI based Map Agent loads once and stays loaded for use with both Apache and Microsoft IIS </li>
  <li>Database connections are pooled and shared between users,  improving performance</li>
  <li>Tile caching ensures map image tiles are only rendered once for the AJAX Viewer no matter how many users are viewing the map</li>
  <li>Connection-oriented, role-based security</li>
  <li>Configurable logging of client access, administrative access, authentication attempts, errors, session lifetimes, and request tracing</li>
  <li>Web-based site administration allows remote site and server configuration, and log file access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Platform Support</h3> 
<ul type="square">
  <li>Deploy on Microsoft Windows or  Linux </li>
  <li>  Serve applications with Apache or Microsoft IIS </li>
  <li>Browse applications with Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and 
    Safari</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> Standards</h3>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Web Map Service</li>
  <li>Web Feature Service</li>
</ul>
