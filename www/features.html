<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Features</h1>
<p>MapGuide Open Source is a web-based platform that enables users to quickly develop and deploy web mapping applications and geo-spatial web services. It is comprised of four major components, the MapGuide Server, MapGuide Web Server Extensions, MapGuide Viewer, and the MapGuide Site Administrator.</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>MapGuide Server Features</h2>
<p>The functionality of the MapGuide Server is broken down into a collection of services each of which adheres to the principles of service-oriented archtecture. The core features of the server include:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Runs as a Daemon on Linux or as a Service on Microsoft Windows.</li>
  <li>Servers can be grouped together into a &quot;Site&quot; to increase scalability. </li>
  <li>Provides connection oriented, role based security.</li>
  <li>Provides configurable logging of client access, administrative access, authentication attempts, errors, session lifetimes, and request tracing. </li>
</ul>

<h2>MapGuide Site Administrator</h2>
</div>

<hr />
<p>MapGuide Open Source is a new  web mapping platform that enables developers to rapidly develop and deploy  valuable spatial applications. It works with the latest PHP, .NET, and Java&trade;  tools to quickly build powerful applications for Windows or Linux server  environments.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can easily publish  spatial views over the web, for viewing in almost any browser.<br />
List is still pretty long &ndash; should  we delete less important features?&nbsp; If  so, what are they?&nbsp; Bob &ndash; please provide  direction or make edits directly.</p>
<div class="h2">
<h2>MapGuide  Server</h2>
<p><strong>Broad  Platform Support</strong><br />
  Runs as a  service under Microsoft&reg; Windows Server&reg; using IIS or  Apache and as a Daemon under Linuxsing Apache.</p>
<p><strong>Server-Side  Application Development and Delivery</strong><br />
  Write  applications that support both raster and vector viewing with the same code. </p>
<p><strong>Multilanguage  Support</strong><br />
  Use .NET,  JavaScript, or PHP through the Web Server Extensions, with 100 percent  consistency between API (application programming interface) calls. </p>
<p><strong>Open  GeoSpatial Agent</strong><br />
  MapGuide  Open Source exposes data and layers via the Open GeoSpatial Web Map Services  (WMS) and Web Feature Services (WFS), thus providing map layers to other  applications.</p>
<p><strong>MapAgent  Service</strong><br />
  Easy set  up and configuration for both secure and nonsecure applications. It accepts  requests from clients over standard HTTP or HTTPS protocols and runs as a  CGI/FastCGI to simplify web server configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous  Connections</strong><br />
  Supports  simultaneous connections (parallel or simultaneous queries) to multiple  database servers, residing locally or on networked Unix or Windows systems. </p>
<p><strong>B</strong><strong>uilt-in,  Access-Based Security Model </strong><br />
  Flexible  control over information distribution, helping to ensure delivery of your data  or application to authorized users only.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong><br />
  Takes full  advantage of multiprocessor architectures, allowing a site to grow to support  large numbers of concurrent users. Servers can be added to provide specific  services, such as raster map rendering. </p>
<p><strong>Web-Based  Administrator</strong><br />
  Remotely administer servers from any browser. Add and remove servers, configure  servers and services, start and stop servers, configure log generation, view  log files, and define users and groups. </p>
</div>
 <div class="h2">
<h2>MapGuide  Viewer</h2>
<p><strong>Flexible  Viewing Options</strong><br />
  Two map viewing options provide similar tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autodesk&reg; DWF&trade; Viewer&mdash;a downloadable  ActiveX control that displays vector-based maps on Windows systems running the  Internet Explorer or Firefox&trade; browser</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>AJAX Viewer&mdash;delivers       raster-based maps to almost any browser</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Portability</strong><br />
  DWF Viewer supports &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo; mode, providing off-line  vector-based map viewing capabilities that maintain data attributes, allowing map  data to be taken into the field for viewing or markup.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple  Object Selection</strong><br />
  Select  objects by list, radius, polygon, buffer, and intersection.</p>
<p><strong>Property  Browser</strong><br />
  The  viewer displays the properties of a selected object as defined by the map  author, providing immediate access to essential attribute data.</p>
<p><strong>Customization</strong><br />
  Customize  the DWF Viewer for use within websites and third-party applications using the  DWF Viewer API. Navigate to a specific page or view, control layer visibility,  show and hide the toolbar and context-sensitive&nbsp;menus, and customize  viewer behavior. </p>
<p><strong>Quality  Printing/Plotting </strong><br />
  DWF  support lets users produce high-quality presentation materials. There&rsquo;s support  for multiple paper sizes, print preview, multiple scale options and control of  elements to print on a page, including plot scale, title, legend, map scale,  north arrow, URL, current date and time&mdash;even a logo  mark. </p>
</div>
<p>BOB &ndash; Not sure how to separate Studio and Web Extensions features  below</p>
<p>The Studio content will not be shown on osgeo site, but will appear  on autodesk.com site.</p>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Autodesk  MapGuide Studio and Web Server Extensions</h2>
<p><strong>Unified  Authoring Environment</strong><br />
  Studio provides a developer-friendly authoring  environment based on popular web development tools provides flexibility, ease  of use, fast prototyping, and rapid application development.&nbsp; Studio eliminates the need to use different  tools for loading data, connecting to databases, and publishing data to the  web. Autodesk MapGuide Studio handles all aspects of collecting and preparing  geospatial data, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use  of Site Explorer&mdash;MDI tabbed window</li>
  <li>Ability  to build stylized and themed layers</li>
  <li>Ability  to compile the layers into a map</li>
  <li>Display  attributes defined by scale</li>
  <li>Automatic  labeling by scale</li>
  <li>Web  layout preview without publishing </li>
  <li>Customizable  popup menu</li>
  <li>Write  application inside frame (native application development)</li>
  <li>And  much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efficient  Data Access </strong><br />
  Uses a  single API&mdash;Feature Data Objects (FDO)&mdash;for accessing your data in ODBC, ArcView&trade; Shape  file, SDF+ file, Oracle&reg; Spatial DB, ArcSDE&trade; database, and other formats. </p>
<p><strong>Raster  Data Management</strong><br />
  Supports  most raster formats, including BMP,   CAL, ECW, JPG, PNG, SID, TGA, and  TIF.</p>
<p><strong>WYSIWYG  Display of Authored Maps</strong><br />
  Easy-to-use  interface provides preview of web layout as well as immediate feedback when  authoring.</p>
<p><strong>Dual  Viewer Applications</strong><br />
  Create a  single application that works with both the DWF Viewer and the AJAX Viewer, for  simplified publishing without extra steps.</p>
<p><strong>Standards  Support</strong><br />
  Open  Geospatial FDO Providers allow use of WMS and WFS as map layers for your  application.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  .<strong>Net  API</strong><br />
  Programmatically  load and organize data from any compatible language to quickly create programs to  do repetitive work.</p>
