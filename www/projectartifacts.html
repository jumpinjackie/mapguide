<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Project Artifacts</h1>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
The MapGuide Open Source development process uses "Artifacts" to track and manage defects, enhancements, and tasks. All changes to MapGuide source code must be tied to an artifact. The Project Tracker application provides a database for storing artifacts along with a web based interface for entering, modifying, and querying artifacts. Each artifact type has a unique collection of "Attributes" (or fields) much like the attributes in a database table. Attributes are presented in "Attribute Groups" that put related attributes into logical groupings. Users are also associated with artifacts via special "User Attributes". All users associated with an artifact are notified any time the artifact changes.
<h3>MapGuide Open Source Artifact Types</h3>
MapGuide Open Source supports the following three artifact types:
<ul type="square">
  <li><a href="#defect">Defect</a> - Used to record and track bugs in an existing component or feature.</li>
  <li><a href="#enhancement">Enhancement</a> - Used to record and track the development of product enhancements.</li>
  <li><a href="#task">Task</a> - Used to record and track work that needs to be done and work in progress.</li>
</ul>
All of these artifact types have a common collection of Attribute Groups (<a href="#common">found here</a>) that are used for tracking the status or lifecycle of artifacts, providing information about code submissions, and for associating users with artifacts.<br />
<br />
To understand how artifacts progress through their lifecycle go <a href="#">here</a>.

Task artifacts are used to record and track work that needs to be done and work in progress. Note that tasks need not be related to product development activities. For example some examples of non development related tasks might be: document a process, write a document on security, define or modify governance rules, things related to conference preparation, etc.
