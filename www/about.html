<h3><a name="mission" id="mission">Mission and Goals</a></h3>
<p>To create, as a community, the leading international web-based platform for developing and deploying web mapping applications and geospatial web services. The goals for the platform are as follows:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>use the  service-oriented architecture pattern</li>
  <li>fast, scalable, and cross platform</li>
  <li>make use of  open source components</li>
  <li>support rich access to spatial data both vector and raster </li>
  <li>provide a full suite of spatial analysis</li>
  <li>produce visually stunning cartographic maps</li>
  <li>include viewers that work within any browser on any platform</li>
  <li>provide the highest degree of map interactivity possible </li>
  <li>offer a single API that works with both vector and raster based client-side viewers </li>
  <li>conform with open standards </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="history" id="history">Historical Background</a></h3>
<p>MapGuide was first introduced as Argus MapGuide in 1995 by Argus Technologies in Calgary, Alberta. Autodesk acquired Argus Technologies in the fall of 1996 and within a few months the first release under the Autodesk brand was introduced, Autodesk MapGuide 2.0. The software progressed through a number of releases leading up to the current Autodesk MapGuide 6.5. To this day MapGuide 6.5 and previous releases are known for ease of deployment, rapid application development, data connectivity, scalability, and overall performance.</p>
<p>Despite it's success the MapGuide 6.5 architecture  has some inherent limitations. To this day most MapGuide applications rely upon a client Plug-in, ActiveX Control, or Java Applet with much of the application logic written in JavaScript using the APIs offered by the client-side plug-in. All spatial analysis is performed client-side on rendered graphics rather than on the underlying spatial data. And finally the server platform is very Windows centric. </p>
<p>In the spring of 2004 a dedicated team of developers began work on what is now MapGuide Open Source. Our goals were simple, retain all of the best aspects of MapGuide 6.5 while also meeting the goals set out above. The result is MapGuide Open Source.</p>
