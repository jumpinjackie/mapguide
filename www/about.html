<h2>Project</h2>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>To create, as a community, the leading international web-based platform for developing and deploying web mapping applications and geo-spatial web services. A platform that follows the service-oriented architecture pattern, is built on open source components, supports rich access to geo-spatial data, provides a full suite of geo-spatial analysis, offers visually stunning cartographic capabilities, and highly interactive map interaction with support for any browser on any platform.</p>
<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>MapGuide was first introduced as Argus MapGuide in 1995 (?) by Argus Technologies in Calgary, Alberta. Autodesk acquired Argus Technologies in the fall of 1996 and within a few months the first release under the Autodesk brand was introduced, Autodesk MapGuide 2.5. The software progressed through a number of releases leading up to the current Autodesk MapGuide 6.5. To this day MapGuide 6.5 and previous releases are known for ease of deployment, rapid application development, data connectivity, and overall performance.</p>
<p>Despite it's success the MapGuide 6.5 architecture  has some inherint limitations. To this day most MapGuide applications rely upon a client Plug-in, ActiveX Control, or Java Applet with much of the application logic written in JavaScript using the APIs of the plug-in. ???? </p>
