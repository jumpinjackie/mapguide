  <dt><a name="1" id="1">1. How is MapGuide Open Source different from the Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 software?</a></dt>
  <dd>Here is a brief list of differences. See the Features page for a complete list of the features of MapGuide Open Source.
    <ul type="square">
	  <li>MapGuide Open Source runs on Linux and Windows. The Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 Server runs only on Windows.</li> 
	  <li>Applications for MapGuide Open Source are written using PHP, ASP.NET, or Java using a new API in the web server environment, whereas MapGuide 6.5 applications make heavy use of a client-side API offered by a browser plug-in.</li> 
	  <li>Viewing MapGuide Open Source applications is provided by a DWF Viewer or an AJAX Viewer rather than the proprietary ActiveX Control, Plug-in, and Java Applet provided with MapGuide 6.5.</li>
	  <li>Use of new FDO technology provides much richer and consistent access to a wide and expanding set of spatial and tabular data sources.</li>
	</ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="2" id="2">2. Can Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 applications run on MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>No. Because of fundamental differences in the product architecture and programming environments, existing Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 applications need to be rewritten to run on MapGuide Open Source. It is not possible to automatically migrate existing Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 applications to the new platform.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="3" id="3">3. Are there any tools to help me migrate my data from Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 to MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>Not at the moment. A tool to aide in the migration of MapGuide 6.5 MWF files and data sources is in development. Because this tool contains proprietary code from MapGuide 6.5 it will not be available as open source.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="4" id="4">4. Can I use Macromedia Cold Fusion to develop with MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>You can in the same way that MapGuide 6.5 applications use Cold Fusion, to display and interact with attribute data. However MapGuide Open Source does expose any API's to ColdFusion.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="5" id="5">5. Can I use reports created in ColdFusion for MapGuide 6.5 with MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes. More detail on how do this will be available soon.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="6" id="6">6. MapGuide needed a plug-in, does MapGuide Open Source also need a plug-in?</a></dt>
  <dd>No. The AJAX Viewer is written entirely in DHTML and does not require a plug-in.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="7" id="7">7. Can I run MapGuide 6.x and MapGuide Open Source in the same environment?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes. Previous versions of MapGuide and MapGuide Open Source can co-exist on the same machine.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="8" id="8">8. Can I use a MapGuide 6.5 Server as a data source for MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>No. At the moment there is no data connector or FDO provider that will allow MapGuide Open Source to use a MapGuide 6.5 Server as a data source.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="9" id="9">9. In MapGuide 6.5 each layer in an MWF can point to a different URL, how can this be achieved in MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>In MapGuide Open Source, a Map Definition can only have layers that point to a single site. However by using MapGuide Open Source as a WMS/WFS service, one MapGuide Server can be chained to another using the WMS or WFS FDO Providers (as soon as they are available).  Thus, we can have a site reference another site by creating a WFS (or WMS) feature source that retrieves data from another MapGuide WFS (or WMS) service.
