  <dt><a name="2" id="2">2. Is PHP required to use MapGuide Open Source? If so why and for what?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes, PHP is always required. PHP is required by the MapGuide Web Server Extentions for the Site Administration web application which is written in PHP. In addition the MapGuide Servers commandline utilties for backing up, restoring, and creating resource packages are written in PHP.</dd>

  <dd>TBD - Need answer here.</dd>

  <dt><a name="5" id="5">5. What Linux distributions has MapGuide Open Source been built and tested on?</a></dt>

  <dt><a name="6" id="6">6. What versions of GCC has MapGuide Open Source been compiled with?</a></dt>
  <dd>At this point MapGuide Open Source has been compiled successfully with GCC 3.2 and 4.0.2. It may compile with other versions as well, but these are the ones we know work.</dd>

  <dt><a name="7" id="7">7. Can I run MapGuide 6.x and MapGuide Open Source in the same environment?</a></dt>
