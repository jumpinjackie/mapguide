  <dt><a name="1" id="1">1. What are the minimum system requirements for MapGuide 
    Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>The system requirements for running MapGuide Open Source are documented 
    here: <a href="system_requirements.html">Requirements</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="2" id="2">2. Is PHP required to use MapGuide Open Source? If so 
    why and for what?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes, PHP is always required. PHP is required by the MapGuide Web Server 
    Extensions for the Site Administration web application which is written in 
    PHP. In addition the MapGuide Servers command line utilities for backing up 
    and restoring the resource database are written in PHP.</dd>
  <dt><a name="3" id="3">3. What version of PHP works with MapGuide Open Source?</a></dt>
  <dd>PHP 5.0.5. Note that PHP 5.1.x is not yet supported by MapGuide Open Source.</dd>
  <dt><a name="4" id="4">4. Can multiple PHP versions co-exist on the same machine 
    with MapGuide Open Source installed?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes, with PHP bundled configuration option, MapGuide Open Source will use 
    the PHP version included with it irrespective of other PHP versions on the 
    system.</dd>
  <dt><a name="5" id="5">5. What Linux distributions has MapGuide Open Source 
    been built and tested on?</a></dt>
  <dd>MapGuide Open Source has been built and tested on Red Hat Enterprise 3.0 
    and Fedora Core 4. We would like to expand this list and invite developers 
    to help us in that effort.</dd>
  <dt><a name="6" id="6">6. What versions of GCC has MapGuide Open Source been 
    compiled with?</a></dt>
  <dd>At this point MapGuide Open Source has been compiled successfully with GCC 
    3.2 and 4.0.2. It may compile with other versions as well, but these are the 
    ones we know work.</dd>
  <dt><a name="7" id="7">7. Can I run MapGuide 6.x and MapGuide Open Source in 
    the same environment?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes. Previous versions of MapGuide and MapGuide Open Source can co-exist 
    on the same machine.</dd>
  <dt><a name="8" id="8">8. Does MapGuide Open Source run on Windows XP?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes, but it's not recommended with IIS. The MapGuide Viewers make multiple 
    simultaneous requests that can easily exceed the default limit set for the 
    personal version of IIS included with XP. MapGuide Open Source runs fine on 
    Windows XP using the Apache Web Server. </dd>
  <dt><a name="9" id="9">9. Can I install MapGuide Open Source on my D: drive?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes. First run from the command line window:
    <p>MgServerSetup.exe &quot;/V INSTALLDIR=D:\Server&quot;</p>
    <p>Then select another folder for the WebExtensions by entering the following 
      at the command line:</p>
    <p>MgWebServerExtensionsSetup.exe &quot;/V INSTALLDIR=D:\Web&quot;</p>
    <p>Ensure that the server and WebExtensions are installed into separate folders. 
      Some of the documentation on MapGuide Open Source assumes a default installation 
      path; please remember to substitute the paths to the new location where 
      ever applicable.</p>
