  MapGuide Open Source &#8211; Technical FAQ - DRAFT </h2>
<h3><br>
  1.0 Installation and Configuration</h3>
<p><strong>What are the minimum system requirements for MapGuide Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>Please see the System Requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Is PHP required to use MapGuide Open Source, if so why and for what?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Linux Distributions has MapGuide Open Source been built and run 
  on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What versions of GCC can I compile MapGuide Open Source with?</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>Can multiple PHP versions be co-existed on the same machine with the 
  MapGuide installed?</strong></p>
<h3>3.0 Viewing and Display</h3>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use the DWF Viewer to create a Windows-based application? 
  For example, Autodesk MapGuide 6.5 has an API which can be loaded in a Visual 
  Basic application. </strong></p>
<p>The DWF Viewer uses ActiveX technology and can therefore run in a Visual Basic 
  context. The EPlot viewer documentation even has some Visual Basic samples. 
  When using the DWF Viewer with MapGuide Open Source you also have access to 
  the EMap API. Note that you're limited as to what you can do with the client-side 
  API, since with MapGuide Open Source the focus is on server-side programming.</p>
<p>Note also that for the client-side portion of your GIS application, the recommended 
  approach with MapGuide Open Source is to use the JavaScript wrappers around 
  the DWF Viewer, since this allows your code to be independent of the viewer 
  technology (DWF Viewer or AJAX Viewer).</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use MapGuide Open Source to generate an image of 
  a map?</strong> </p>
<p>The GetMapImage HTTP operation lets you generate a PNG image of a map. You 
  simply need to specify the name of the MapDefinition resource with the request. 
  Additional parameters let you control the center and scale of the generated 
  image. See the GetMapImage test form for the full set of options.</p>
<p><strong>What are base layers? How are they different from regular layers?</strong> 
</p>
<p>The map content for base layers is displayed using tiles. These tiles are rendered 
  on demand and stored in a server-side cache. As you pan and zoom, any newly 
  visible tiles are requested from the server. Assuming the cache for your map 
  is reasonably populated, these pan and zoom operations should work smoothly. 
  (Note that this tile behavior applies only to the AJAX viewer. DWF Viewer handles 
  base layers the same as regular layers.)</p>
<p>Base layers are best used to display map content which doesn't change frequently, 
  e.g. static data such as geographical features.</p>
<p><strong>I've added base layers to my map. Why don't they don't display correctly?</strong></p>
<p>Verify that the map contains a proper set of finite scales at which to render 
  the base layers. The minimum and maximum finite scales should roughly match 
  the limits at which you want your map to be viewed. Also, the relative factor 
  between intermediate finite scales should not be too large (a factor of 2 is 
  a good starting point).</p>
<p><strong>Can I use Macromedia Cold Fusion to develop with MapGuide Open Source?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MapGuide needed a plugin, does MapGuide Open Source also need a plugin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I run MapGuide 6.x and MapGuide Open Source on the same environment 
  and share data sources? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I setup my MapGuide Open Source application as a Visual Studio 
  .Net project? Is there a sample Visual Studio .Net project using MapGuide Open 
  Source?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you need a Berkley DB license to use MapGuide Open Source? How does 
  MapGuide Open Source use Berkely DB?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the map authoring tools for the system? Where is the loaded 
  site?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can different MapGuide supported services be scaled and how?</strong></p>
<p>What is the memory usage if large amount of data are used e.g. 100 - 200 Gb?</p>
<p><strong>How do I use the Text Expression Editor to combine property values 
  and text constants to form a URL or feature label? </strong></p>
<p>A text expression is a concatenation of multiple string items. When the Text 
  Expression Editor is in &#8220;Builder&#8221; mode, click &#8220;New&#8221; 
  to add an item to the expression. Select each item and define its Text Value 
  to be a property name, a constant string, or a number expression. The &#8220;Builder&#8221; 
  editor converts this input into the text expression that is saved with a layer. 
  Click the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; button to view and edit the text expression 
  in its native format.</p>
<p>The syntax for text expressions is:</p>
<p>Expression = &#8220;&lt;Property&gt;&#8221;</p>
<p>| &#8216;&lt;Constant&gt;&#8217;</p>
<p>| (&lt;NumberExpression&gt;)</p>
<p>| concat(&lt;Expression&gt;, &lt;Expression&gt;)</p>
<p><strong>How do I force floating point values to appear as integers in my feature 
  labels? </strong> </p>
<p>Feature labels may include number expressions, which can simply be the name 
  of a number-bearing feature property, or can be a complex calculation involving 
  multiple properties and constants. The numerical type (integer or real) for 
  these expressions is taken from the first property or constant in the expression. 
  If the feature property AREA contains real numbers, the label &#8220;AREA&#8221; 
  will display real numbers. If the label expression is altered to first reference 
  an integer, integer values will be displayed: &#8220;(0 + AREA)&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have defined an extension in my feature souce that joins a primary feature 
  source with a secondary feature source that has multiple matching records to 
  the primary features. Can I specify which record from the secondary feature 
  to retrieve from the join?</p>
<p>The result of a join defined by the feature source extension will be an extension 
  that consists of the primary feature properties and the secondary feature properties. 
  The secondary properties will be populated with values from the first matching 
  record from the secondary feature source.</p>
<p><strong>Why won&#8217;t my 500Mb+ SHP files load?</strong></p>
<p>There is an outstanding defect against loading large SHP files. The problem 
  is with the SHP FDO provider (defect 761033, status: deferred).<br>
