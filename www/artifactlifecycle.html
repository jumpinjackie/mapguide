<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Artifact Lifecycle</h1>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
All artifacts in the MapGuide Open Source project follow a rigid lifecycle and all project development occurs within that lifecycle. This lifecycle is managed and tracked through the <a href="projectartifacts.html#common">Status Attribute Group</a> that all artifact types share. In particular the value of the <a href="#artifactStatus">Status</a> attribute indicates where in its lifecycle the artifact is. At any point which status transistions are allowed depend upon three things, the current status, the allowed  transistions from that status, and the user's role.  The following diagram shows the possible status transistions of an artifact.
<div align="center"><br /><img src="images/artifactlifecycle.png" alt="Artifact Life Cycle" /><br /></div>
When an artifacts status moves to Assigned, Resolution Proposed, or Resolved a user must be specified in the "Assigned To" attribute. Likewise when an artifact moves into the Resolved status a Resolution must be set. The following tables show the meanining of each Status value, the Resolution values, and the status transistions allowed for each user role.

<div class="h2">
<a name="artifactStatus" id="artifactStatus"><h2>Artifact Status</h2></a>
<p>The "Status" attribute of an artifact indicates where in its lifecycle the artifact is. All artifacts start in either the Unconfirmed or New state depending on the role of the person entering the artifact.</p>
