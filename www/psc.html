<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Project Steering Committee [DRAFT]</h1>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Project Steering Committee (PSC) is the official governing body of the MapGuide Open Source Project and is responsible
 for all aspects of managing the project, including setting the overall direction of the project and releases, determining what
 features go in and when, and how those features are implemented. This document descibes the structure of the PSC, the 
 responsibilities of the PSC, and the process by which it operates.</p>
<p>The definition of the MapGuide Open Source PSC derives from the guidelines already developed for the
 <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/development/rfc/ms-rfc-1/" target="_blank">MapServer Technical Steering Committee</a>, the
 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/0+Project+Steering+Committee" target="_blank">GeoServer PSC</a>, and the 
 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAP/Contributers+Guide" target="_blank">MapBuilder PSC</a>.

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The PSC is made up of individuals consisting of developers and users. Members are elected to participate in the
 PSC based on merit irrespective of their organizational ties. The PSC is made up of an odd number of members (5 or more)
 to prevent ties in the voting process. One member of the PSC is appointed Chair, who has additional responsibilities to
 organize regular meetings and to resolve tie votes should they occur. The Chair is the ultimate adjudicator should the
 process ever breakdown entirely.</p>
<h3>Current PSC</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jason Birch</li>
	<li>Bob Bray (Chair)</li>
	<li>Bruce Dechant</li>
	<li>Tom Fukushima</li>
	<li>Andy Morsell</li>
	<li>Paul Spencer</li>
	<li>TBD - Open</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding Members</h3>
<p>Any member of the PSC or the mapguide-dev mailing list may nominate someone for committee membership at any time. Only
 existing PSC members may vote on new members. Nominees must recieve a majority vote from existing members to be added to
 the PSC.</p>
<h3>Stepping Down</h3>
<p>Turnover within the PSC is allowed and expected as people move from one project to another or simply move on to a 
 different role. If for any reason a PSC member is not able to fully participate then they are free to step down. If a
 member is not active (e.g. no voting, mailing list, or IRC participation) for a period of two months then the PSC 
reserves the right to remove that member from the PSC (via a vote) and to seek nominations to fill that position.</p>
