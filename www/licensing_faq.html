  <dt><a name="1" id="1">1.</a> What open source license covers MapGuide Open 
    Source? </dt>
  <dd>MapGuide Open Source is licensed under the <a href="lgpl.html">LGPL</a> 
    (GNU Lesser General Public License). This license complies with the open source 
    definition set forth by the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source 
    Initiative</a> and is on the Open Source Initiative&rsquo;s list of approved 
    open source licenses. </dd>
  <dt><a name="2" id="2">2.</a> Why are you using the LGPL? </dt>
  <dd>We have chosen the LGPL for a number of reasons, the most important of which 
    is that we believe the LGPL strikes the best balance between two important 
    yet often competing goals. The LGPL gives MapGuide Open Source users the assurance 
    that any modifications or enhancements to the source code will remain open 
    and freely available. At the same time, the LGPL allows commercial vendors 
    to build and distribute proprietary applications and systems using MapGuide 
    Open Source without any requirement that their commercial products also be 
    licensed as open source. We believe that offering an open yet &ldquo;business-friendly&rdquo; 
    license is necessary to promote the widespread adoption of MapGuide Open Source, 
    and this is precisely why we chose the LGPL. </dd>
  <dt><a name="3" id="3">3.</a> What does the LGPL allow me to do with MapGuide 
    Open Source? </dt>
  <dd>The LGPL allows you to use MapGuide Open Source software on a standalone 
    basis or as a component of your applications, provided that if you link your 
    proprietary software to MapGuide Open Source, you do so using dynamic linking. 
    You may make unlimited copies of MapGuide Open Source and distribute unlimited 
    copies of the software without payment of any royalties or license fees. And, 
    as with any open source license, you are free to make enhancements and modifications 
    to MapGuide Open Source. The LGPL does not require you to share the source 
    code of your enhancements unless you distribute changed versions of MapGuide 
    Open Source to third parties. However, if you distribute your changed versions 
    to others, you must make the changed source code available to parties to whom 
    you distribute your changed versions under the LGPL. </dd>
  <dt><a name="4" id="4">4.</a> Can I use MapGuide Open Source to create my own 
    proprietary applications? </dt>
  <dd>Yes. Unlike the GNU General Public License (GPL), the LGPL does not force 
    you to open source your application just because you integrate it with code 
    from MapGuide Open Source. If your application merely links dynamically to 
    MapGuide Open Source software at runtime, and does not include a changed version 
    of MapGuide Open Source, you have created what the license refers to as a 
    &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo; and you need only comply with the 
    requirements in Section 6 of the LGPL. Broadly speaking, this section requires 
    you simply to give notice that your application contains LGPL code and pass 
    along a copy of the license and a copyright notice for MapGuide Open Source. 
  </dd>
  <dd>Only if you modify the MapGuide Open Source software itself have you created 
    what the LGPL refers to as a &ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo;, in which 
    case your application would have to be licensed as open source under the LGPL. 
    The bottom line is that you never have to disclose proprietary source code 
    that links to MapGuide Open Source if you don&rsquo;t want to. </dd>
  <dt><a name="5" id="5">5.</a> How does the LGPL benefit me as a developer or 
    end-user of MapGuide Open Source? </dt>
  <dd>Apart from the clear advantages of making available free and open source 
    code for development and maintenance purposes, the LGPL gives MapGuide Open 
    Source users the assurance that any modifications or enhancements to the source 
    code will also remain open and freely available. Under the LGPL, anyone that 
    makes enhancements to the MapGuide Open Source source code is required to 
    reciprocate by making those changes available when the code is redistributed. 
    Some open source licenses such as the MIT or BSD licenses do not contain this 
    reciprocity obligation. The result is that although the software initially 
    distributed under those licenses is open source, modified versions of that 
    software are not required to be open source. Companies can take this software 
    and create closed proprietary versions, or create &ldquo;forks&rdquo;, which 
    can result in incompatible versions of MapGuide Open Source being distributed 
    by different vendors. </dd>
  <dd>The LGPL makes it far less likely that MapGuide Open Source will be forked 
    into incompatible versions, because no one can prevent changes from being 
    distributed freely within the community. The LGPL thus helps to promote a 
    single worldwide standard for MapGuide Open Source that is available to everyone 
    for free. </dd>
  <dt><a name="6" id="6">6.</a> May I take a portion of the MapGuide Open Source 
    code and use it to extend and improve another application? </dt>
  <dd>Yes. You may freely modify, extend, and improve the MapGuide Open Source 
    source code, either for use with MapGuide Open Source itself or in connection 
    with another software application, as long as your extensions integrate with 
    MapGuide Open Source through dynamic linking. Of course, if you distribute 
    the modifications you must comply with the LGPL&rsquo;s requirement that the 
    changed source code be made freely available. </dd>
  <dt><a name="7" id="7">7.</a> What are the terms of using the third party software 
    that is included within MapGuide Open Source? </dt>
  <dd>MapGuide Open Source relies on a number of third party modules that are 
    included in the source code distribution. Many of these modules are made available 
    under either the LGPL or under permissive, non-reciprocal open source licenses 
    such as the MIT, BSD or Apache licenses. The exception to this is the Berkeley 
    DB XML database and XQuery query engine, which are used by MapGuide Open Source 
    for data storage and querying. These software products are licensed under 
    the Sleepycat Public License, which imposes certain terms on licensees who 
    distribute applications that use Berkeley DB XML. One of these terms is a 
    requirement that the source code of your application that uses Berkeley DB 
    XML be included in the distribution, and that the source code be &quot;freely 
    redistributable under reasonable conditions.&quot; This requirement is described 
    in more detail at <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/company/licensing.html">http://www.sleepycat.com/company/licensing.html</a> 
  </dd>
  <dd>We have no legal authority over third party modules used in MapGuide Open 
    Source. You should carefully read the license requirements for each of these 
    modules and contact the respective authors for any clarification on allowed 
    uses and requirements. For a complete listing and associated license requirements 
    of the third party software included in the MapGuide Open Source distribution, 
    see the &ldquo;license.htm&rdquo; file included in the source code. </dd>
  <dt><a name="8" id="8">8.</a> Autodesk contributed the original code for MapGuide 
    Open Source. Can Autodesk ever take it back? </dt>
  <dd>No. Once code is released under the LGPL, it cannot be withdrawn. Autodesk 
    is firmly committed to the MapGuide Open Source project and has no plans to 
    return to a closed development model for this product. Like other developers 
    working on the MapGuide Open Source project, Autodesk expects to contribute 
    further enhancements to the code base that will be licensed under the LGPL. 
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="9" id="9">9.</a> What if I want to contribute my code to the MapGuide 
    Open Source project? </dt>
  <dd>The governance model currently being formulated by the MapServer Foundation 
    members will define how code will be added to Foundation software projects, 
    and what contributor agreement will be required. The Foundation will emulate 
    other successful open source projects utilizing an active meritocracy model. 
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="10" id="10">10. </a>Do MapGuide Enterprise or MapGuide Open Source 
    users need to pay a separate licensing fee because we license a third party 
    database?</dt>
  <dd> 
    No. In fact, anyone developing with MapGuide Enterprise is protected from 
      paying additional licensing fees. MapGuide Enterprise uses Berkeley DB, 
      a database program from Sleepycat Software. Autodesk and Sleepycat have 
      signed an OEM license agreement that allows Autodesk to include Berkeley 
      DB within MapGuide Enterprise, and to sublicense the program to MapGuide 
      Enterprise customers. Thus, any enterprise customer can use MapGuide Enterprise 
      and build applications on MapGuide Enterprise without ever having to pay 
      any license fees to Sleepycat.
  </dd>
 
  <dd>
    Berkeley DB is also contained within the MapGuide Open Source product. 
      MapGuide Open Source does not rely on Autodesk&#8217;s OEM license agreement 
      with Sleepycat. Rather, the Berkeley DB contained within MapGuide Open Source 
      is made available under the Sleepycat Public License, an open source license 
      similar to the GPL. Thus, developers can use Berkeley DB for free within 
      MapGuide Open Source and freely build applications on MapGuide Open Source 
      under the terms of that open source license. Developers can also repackage 
      MapGuide Open Source and sell it as their solution without any additional 
      licensing fees so long as the source code for that solution is made available 
      (as required by the Sleepycat Public License). The only instance where a 
      developer would need to pay Sleepycat a separate licensing fee is if they 
      are distributing their own version of MapGuide Open Source (*not* MapGuide 
      Enterprise) or building applications on top of MapGuide Open Source and 
      do not make the source code for the programs available to their customers.
