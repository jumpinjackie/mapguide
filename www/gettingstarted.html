<div class="h2">
<h2><a name="1" id="1">Getting MapGuide Up and Running</a></h2>
<p>To get MapGuide Open Source up and running on your system, follow these five steps:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>1. Download and install the MapGuide Server and MapGuide Web Server Extensions.</dt>
  <dd>For Windows visit the <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a> and download MgServerSetup.exe and MgWebServerExtensionsSetup.exe. Then follow the steps in the <a href="docs/InstallConfigureMgOpenSourceOnWindows.pdf" target="_blank">Installing MapGuide on Windows</a> document to install the software.<br /><br />
    For Linux visit the MapGuide Open Source <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a> and the Feature Data Objects <a href="https://fdo.osgeo.org/downloads.html">downloads page</a> and download mapguideopensource-1.0.1.tar.gz, mapguideaptinstaller-1.0.1.tar.gz (optional), and fdo-3.1.0_R050.tar.gz. Then follow the steps in the <a href="docs/BuildConfigureMgOpenSourceOnLinux.pdf" target="_blank">Building MapGuide on Linux</a> document to configure, make, and install the software.</dd>
  
  <dt>2. Download and extract the sample application.</dt>
  <dd>Visit the <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a> and download phpviewersample.zip. On Windows extract the files to C:\Program Files\MapGuideOpenSource\WebServerExtensions\www. On Linux extract the files to /usr/local/mapguideopensource/webserverextensions/www. Note that in both cases it should create a folder called phpviewersample under www.</dd>
  
  <dt>3. Download the sample data.</dt>
  <dd>Visit the <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a> and download the resource package Sheboygan.mgp. On Windows copy the file to  C:\Program Files\MapGuideOpenSource\Server\Packages. On Linux copy the file to /usr/local/mapguideopensource/server/packages.</dd>
  
  <dt>4. Load the sample data using the Site Administrator application.</dt>
  <dd>Open a web browser to the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8008/mapguide/mapadmin/login.php">http://localhost:8008/mapguide/mapadmin/login.php</a>. Login using the user id "Administrator" and the default password "admin". When you see the Manage Servers page appear, select "Load Packages" in the left navigation bar. Select the radio button next to Sheboygan.mgp and click "Load Package".</dd>

  <dt>5. Launch the sample application.</dt>
  <dd>Finally open a web browser to the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8008/mapguide/phpviewersample/ajaxtiledviewersample.php">http://localhost:8008/mapguide/phpviewersample/ajaxtiledviewersample.php</a> to launch the sample application.</dd>
</dl>
At this point you should have MapGuide Open Source up and running. To find out more read the rest of this guide, look through the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, and visit the <a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a> to view the developer documetation. </div>

<h2><a name="2" id="2">Components of the MapGuide Platform</a></h2>
<p>The MapGuide Open Source platform consists of components that run in one of three tiers, as shown below. These components can all run on a single computer or may be distributed across multiple computers as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p><img src="images/mapguide_components.png" alt="MapGuide Platform Components" width="481" height="481" /></p>

<h3>MapGuide Server</h3>
<p>The MapGuide Server hosts the MapGuide Open Source services and responds to requests from client applications through TCP/IP protocol. The server provides seven services : Site Service, Resource Service, Drawing Service, Feature Service, Mapping Service, Rendering Service, and Tile Service. If you are using a single server, that server performs all of these services. If you have more than one server, the site server always runs the first four services which handle data access and manage the resources for the site. The Mapping and Rendering services can be split off and allocated to other support servers. The MapGuide Server runs on either Microsoft Windows or Linux.</p>

<h3>MapGuide Web Server Extensions</h3>
<p>The MapGuide Web Server Extensions are internal components that have no UI but are accessed through the MapGuide Web API. The Web Extensions include a  MapAgent CGI/Fast-CGI module that exposes the services offered by the MapGuide Server to client applications over the Internet or an intranet using the HTTP protocol. The MapGuide Web API supports three development languages/environments: ASP.NET, Java/JSP, and PHP. The MapGuide Web Server Extensions run on either Microsoft Windows or Linux and work with either the Apache Web Server or Microsoft IIS.</p>

<h3>MapGuide Viewer</h3>
<p>MapGuide Open Source offers two viewer technologies: a DWF™-based viewer and an AJAX-based viewer. Both viewer technologies offer a common user interface and expose a JavaScript API. That API is common between the two viewers, which allows applications to be written that will work equally well with either viewer.</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><strong>DWF Viewer</strong> - The DWF Viewer embeds the downloadable Autodesk DWF Viewer which is based on a Microsoft ActiveX Control with full support for the Autodesk DWF format. This viewer works in Microsoft Internet Explorer only.
  </li>
  <li><strong>AJAX Viewer</strong> - The AJAX Viewer is a pure DHTML viewer based on AJAX technology that does not require any downloadable plug-ins. This viewer works in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Autodesk MapGuide&#8482; Studio</h3>
<p>MapGuide Studio is a commercial authoring tool for MapGuide Open Source offered by Autodesk. MapGuide Studio handles all aspects of preparing maps and geospatial data for use with MapGuide Open Source. Modeled after popular web development tools, Studio provides a unified environment that enables you to rapidly create spatial applications using an intuitive and familiar interface. MapGuide Studio runs only on Microsoft Windows. More information about MapGuide Studio and a downloadable trial version is available at: <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/mapguidestudio">www.autodesk.com/mapguidestudio</a>.</p>

<h3>MapGuide Web Studio</h3>
<p>MapGuide Web Studio is a web-based authoring tool for defining  data source, layer and map resources. MapGuide Web Studio is an AJAX application that works across platforms and with multiple web browsers including FireFox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. Unlike MapGuide Studio, it is not a separate product component, but it is installed as a part of the MapGuide Web Server Extensions.</p>

<h3>MapGuide Site Administrator</h3>
<p>The MapGuide Site Administrator is an application for managing your site and its servers. This application uses a web-based interface that you can access from any web browser. To start the program, open a browser and enter: http://servername:port/mapguide/mapadmin/login.php, using the name of the site server and port that you specified during installation. You use the MapGuide Site Administrator to add and remove servers, take servers offline for maintenance, modify the configuration of a server, assign services to the servers, and monitor the status of any server. The MapGuide Site Administrator is not a separate product component, but it is installed as a part of the MapGuide Web Server Extensions.</p>

<h3>Feature Data Objects</h3>
The Feature Data Objects (FDO) API is a set of commands for manipulating, defining, and analyzing geospatial information. MapGuide Open Source uses FDO to access data in a variety of geospatial data sources. An FDO Provider is a specific implementation of the FDO API. It is the software component that provides access to data in a particular data format or data store. FDO is a seperate open source project available from <a href="https://fdo.osgeo.org">fdo.osgeo.org</a>.
