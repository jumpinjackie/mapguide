<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Getting Involved as a Developer</h1>
<p><strong>NOTE: All of the information on this page is subject to change as the Open Source Geospatial Foundation makes decisions regarding it's governance.</strong></p>

<p>There are two different levels of involvement for developers interested in contributing to MapGuide Open Source.  These levels of involvement are defined by the  Project Contributor and Project Developer roles as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project Contributor</strong> - A Project Contributors is a developer who contributes patches, code, and/or documentation through the Project Tracker tool. Project Contributors do not have Subversion   check-in access.  Integration of a developers'   contributions is at the discretion of the Project Owner and individuals in the Project Developer role. This is typically an   iterative, communicative process.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Developer</strong> -  A Project Developer has full commit access to the trunk of the source tree. Project Developers can directly make changes to the source base of the   development branch, from which the nightly builds are made. Project Developers review and accept code submitted by Project Contributors. </li>
</ul>
<p>All developers on the project start out as Project Contributors. A developer who has sent in solid, useful patches  can be elevated   to the Project Developer role by the Project Steering Committee (PSC). To become a Project Contributor use the <a href="https://mapguide.osgeo.org/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request   project membership/role</a> link at the top of the MapGuide Open Source project   home page and request the Project Contributor role. </p>
<p>Please note that when the Open Source Geospatial Foundations governance model is fully defined, developers may be asked to sign a &quot;Contributor's Agreement&quot; similar to what   Apache Software Foundation requires.<br />

<h2>Areas of Need</h2>
<p>If you are looking to get involved the following aspects of MapGuide Open Source could use your help:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Bug Fixes - MapGuide Open Source is a 1.0.0 release and as such, probably contains a bug or two that needs to be fixed.</li>
  <li>Platform Expansion - MapGuide Open Source is currently only being built and tested on Red Hat Enterprise 3 and Fedora Core 4. Updates to the code and make files to support as many Linux distributions as possible is greatly encouraged.</li>
  <li>Localization into new Languages - MapGuide Open Source is fully globalized, localized in English with a Japanese localization effort under way. Support for additional locals is very desirable. </li>
  <li>Documentation - The API reference documentation is a little rough around the edges and the CGI interface to MapGuide Open Source is currently undocumented. </li>
</ul>
