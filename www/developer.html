<h1>MapGuide Open Source - Getting Involved as a Developer</h1>
<p><strong>NOTE: All of the information on this page is subject to change as the Open Source Geospatial Foundation makes decisions regarding its governance.</strong></p>

<p>There are three different levels of involvement for developers interested in contributing to MapGuide Open Source.  These levels of involvement are  as follows:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><strong>Project Contributor</strong> - A Project Contributor is a developer who contributes patches, code, and/or documentation through the Project Tracker tool. Project Contributors do not have Subversion check-in access. Integration of a developer's   contributions is at the discretion of the MapGuide Open Source Project Steering Comittee (PSC) and individuals in the Project Developer role. This is typically an   iterative, communicative process.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Developer</strong> -  A Project Developer has full commit access to the trunk of the source tree and has a signed Contributor License Agreement on file with OSGeo. Project Developers can directly make changes to the source base of the   development branch, from which the nightly builds are made. Project Developers review and accept code submitted by Project Contributors. Project Developers are elected by  the PSC.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Steering Committee  (PSC) Member </strong>&ndash; The MapGuide Open Source PSC is the entity that manages the project.&nbsp; A PSC Member is a Project Developer that was  elected to the MapGuide Open Source PSC due to the developer&rsquo;s merit and active  participation in the project.&nbsp; PSC  Members have full commit access to the code repository, the right to vote for  project-related decisions, and the right to propose individuals for Project  Developer status.</li>
</ul>
<p>All developers on the project start out as Project Contributors. A developer who has sent in solid, useful patches  can be elevated   to the Project Developer role by the Project Steering Committee (PSC). To become a Project Contributor use the <a href="https://mapguide.osgeo.org/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request   project membership/role</a> link at the top of the MapGuide Open Source project   home page and request the Project Contributor role. </p>
<p>Please note that the Open Source Geospatial Foundation is currently  defining its governance model and intellectual property policies, including the  policy under which the OSGeo accepts code contributions from developers.&nbsp; Until these policies are fully defined, we  cannot grant Project Developer status to any individual.&nbsp; It is expected that developers will be asked  to sign a Contributor License Agreement similar to what Apache Software  Foundation requires before becoming a Project Developer or PSC Member.<br />

<h2>Areas of Need</h2>
<p>If you are looking to get involved the following aspects of MapGuide Open Source could use your help:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Bug Fixes - MapGuide Open Source is a 1.0.0 release and as such, probably contains a bug or two that needs to be fixed.</li>
  <li>Platform Expansion - MapGuide Open Source is currently only being built and tested on Red Hat Enterprise 3 and Fedora Core 4. Updates to the code and make files to support as many Linux distributions as possible is greatly encouraged.</li>
  <li>Localization into new Languages - MapGuide Open Source is fully globalized, localized in English with a Japanese localization effort under way. Support for additional locales is very desirable. </li>
  <li>Documentation - The API reference documentation is a little rough around the edges and the CGI interface to MapGuide Open Source is currently undocumented. </li>
</ul>
