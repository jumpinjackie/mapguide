Supplemental Development Options
================================

If the MapGuide Web Extensions and viewer APIs do not cover your development needs or you are looking for other available options for MapGuide application development, other options are available to you.

.. _openlayers:

OpenLayers
----------

OpenLayers is a free and open source javascript library that makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, iamges and markers loaded from any source.

OpenLayers includes a MapGuide layer type, allowing for your MapGuide maps to be integrated into the OpenLayers ecosystem with other Map Servers and other data sources.

Visit `the OpenLayers homepage <http://www.openlayers.org>`_ for more information

.. note::

    Fusion is also built on top of OpenLayers, so any OpenLayers knowledge you have is also applicable here.

.. _maestroapi:

Maestro API
-----------

MapGuide Maestro is a free and open source authoring tool for MapGuide Open Source / Autodesk Infrastructure Map Server. It is an alternative to Autodesk MapGuide Studio.

The Maestro API is a 100% fully managed .net class library that provides the following features:

 * A strongly-typed service client interface to the http mapagent, that alleviates the need for boilerplate http request/response processing.
 * An object model for working with resources in terms of classes and interfaces instead of raw XML content, with support for many different schema versions.
 * A unified programming interface that can work with the mapagent or the MapGuide Server directly
 * Easy integration with both web (ASP.net) and desktop (WinForms/WPF) enviroments
 * Support for many different versions of MapGuide

This library is used by the MapGuide Maestro application, and can be used in your own applications.
