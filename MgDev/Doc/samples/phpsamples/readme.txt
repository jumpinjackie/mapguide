MapGuide Developer's Guide PHP Samples README
----------------------------------------------

This is the complete set of PHP samples referenced in the MapGuide Developer's Guide

Notes
-----

These samples assume that MapGuide Open Source is installed in the default location in
C:\Program Files\OSGeo\MapGuide

If this is not the case edit common/common.php and change the paths to match your install location

These samples require a user named "Author" (pass: author) with authoring privileges. This is a default user in a standard MapGuide installation. If you have deleted or modified this user, edit main.php and update with a matching login

These samples require the Sheboygan sample dataset. Load this package first before running the samples.
