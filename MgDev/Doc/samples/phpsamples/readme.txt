MapGuide Developer's Guide PHP Samples README
----------------------------------------------

This is the complete set of PHP samples referenced in the MapGuide Developer's Guide

Notes
-----

You must use the Sheboygan sample data set that was released with MapGuide Open Source 2.6 or newer. This dataset has been updated and
these samples have been updated to work against this version of the data set.

These samples assume that MapGuide Open Source is installed in the default location in
C:\Program Files\OSGeo\MapGuide

If this is not the case edit common/common.php and change the paths to match your install location

These samples require a user named "Author" (pass: author) with authoring privileges. This is a default user in a standard MapGuide installation. If you have deleted or modified this user, edit main.php and update with a matching login

These samples require the Sheboygan sample dataset. Load this package first before running the samples.
