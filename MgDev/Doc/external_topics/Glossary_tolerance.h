\addtogroup tolerance

<p>
	Tolerance reflects the distance that two points can be apart
and still be considered the same (for example, to accommodate
rounding errors). The tolerance value must be a positive
number greater than zero. \link OSUGR [OSUGR] \endlink. Tolerances
are used in some geometric test, mostly for equality between
coordinates. Such tests occur frequently in spatial queries
with conditions such as &quot;on boundary&quot; or &quot;just touching&quot;. A
tolerance can also be used when formulating step distances
for parametric curve interpolation.
