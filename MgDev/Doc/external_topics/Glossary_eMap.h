/** 
\addtogroup eMap
\note1
<p>
A \link DWF DWF \endlink file containing metadata about the image to be
displayed. The DWF Viewer uses this metadata, along with
information about the current scale, center of the image, and
size of the browser window, to request image data from the
MapGuide server.
</p>
<p>
Since they only contain metadata, eMaps are not self
contained.
