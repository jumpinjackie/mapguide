\section summary \ProdName Web API Reference

For detailed information about using the Web API see the \DevGuide.

Maps are made up of layers, where each layer displays features from a feature class. See
\ref Maps_and_Layers_Module "Maps and Layers" for more details.

Much of the work with this API is done through the following services:

 - \ref Resource_Service_Module "Resource Service": manipulates resources and repositories.
 - \ref Feature_Service_Module "Feature Service": provides access to FDO providers.
 - \ref Rendering_Service_Module "Rendering Service": renders a map into a bitmapped image.
 - \ref Drawing_Service_Module "Drawing Service": allows low level access to drawing sources (DWF data).
 - \ref Mapping_Service_Module "Mapping Service": generates eMaps and ePlots for viewing with the DWF Viewer.
 - \ref Site_Service_Module "Site Service": configures users, groups, and user sessions.
 - \ref Tile_Service_Module "Tile Service": supports smooth pans and zooms in the AJAX Viewer.

Some other important areas of the API are:

 - \ref Coordinate_System_Module "Coordinate System": supports coordinate system transformations.
 - \ref Geometry_Module "Geometry": manipulates geometric objects.
 - \ref Collections_Module "Collections": classes to hold collections of objects.
 - \ref Common_Module "Common": common utility classes.
 - \ref Exceptions_Module "Exceptions"
 
The API uses XML data extensively. The schemas are documented in \ref XML_Schemas_Module "XML Schemas".
