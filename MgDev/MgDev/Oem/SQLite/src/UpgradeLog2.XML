The 'Use Managed Extensions' property, which equated to the C/C++ Compiler switch /clr in Visual Studio 2002 and 2003, has been expanded to several values in order to support new features. /clr has been converted to /clr:oldSyntax for you, but there are a variety of switch compatibility issues that you need to be aware of. (For instance, /Zl was added to projects that were created with Visual Studio 2003, but may no longer be appropriate. Because it may be appropriate to your particular project we have not removed it if it existed, but you may want to).&#xA;Please see MSDN for details and additional information.
