How to configure and build TUX:


1.) run "autoreconf" to create all of the configure scripts in the sub-folders. You may want to run "autoreconf -v" since the default is a long silent command

2.) run "./configure" to create all of the makefiles in the sub-folders

3.) run "make" to build TUX. You may get some errors when you run it the first time. just rerun the "make" command

4.) change to the folder Server/Mapserver/src/Core and run mapserver to run the Tux server
