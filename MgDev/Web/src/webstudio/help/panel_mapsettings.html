<h1>Map Settings Panel</h1>
<p>The map settings panel is used to configure general map properties not related to the layers that make up the map.  This includes:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>A descriptive name for the map that can be used in client applications.</dd>
    <dt>Coordinate System</dt>
    <dd>A Well Known Text (WKT) coordinate system to render the map in.  This can be different than the coordinate system of the feature sources that are included in the map as feature sources are automatically re-projected into the output projection.  One exception to this is raster feature sources, which are assumed to be in the projection of the map and are never re-projected.  You can change the coordinate system by clicking the [...] button to the right and choosing a new coordinate system from the list.  Currently the MapGuide Open Source server does not advertise which projections it supports to the client.  Consequently, the projection list only contains projections which have been added to Web Studio by the administrator.  If you are an administrator, see the Web Studio Administrator's Guide for information on configuring Web Studio.</dd>
    <dt>Background Color</dt>
    <dd>Enter an 8 digit hex code (AARRGGBB) for the background color of the map.  The background color will be visible where there are no features rendered, or the features are transparently filled.</dd>
    <dt>Initial View</dt>
    <dd>The initial extents to use when loading the map into an application.  The client does not have to use these extents.  The extents must be expressed in the units of the coordinate system of the map.</dd>
