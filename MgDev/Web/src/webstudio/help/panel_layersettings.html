<h1>Layer Settings Panel</h1>
<p>The layer settings panel is used to configure properties of a layer that do not directly affect its representation on the map.  The data section allows you to choose a Feature Source resource to use as the source of data for this layer.  All other properties of a layer are dependent on the feature source selected.  You must select a feature source in order to configure and style a layer.  If you choose to change the feature source associated with a layer, all properties and styling information will be lost, so only change the feature source for new layers or if you are really, really sure you want to.</p>
<h2>Feature Data Setup</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Feature Class</dt>
    <dd>A feature source may provide one or more feature classes.  Changing feature classes will remove any selected properties and styling information.</dd>
    <dt>Geometry</dt>
    <dd>A feature class may provide one or more geometries.  Changing geometries will remove any existing styling information.</dd>
    <dt>Properties</dt>
    <dd>You can choose which attributes of the selected feature class will be visible to the user when a feature on this layer is selected.  To make an attribute available, check the checkbox next to the property and supply a display name if desired.</dd>
    <dt>Filter</dt>
    <dd>You can select a layer-wide filter to apply to the feature source.  This filter is used by the FDO provider to limit the features used to draw the layer.  Use the [...] button to the right of the filter to open the expression builder and create a <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('dialog_expressionbuilder.html#filter')">filter expression</a>.</dd>
    <dt>URL</dt>
    <dd>Does anyone know what this does?</dd>
    <dt>Tool tip</dt>
    <dd>You can specify an expression used to display a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over a feature on this layer.  Use the [...] button to the right of the tool tip to open the expression builder and create a <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('dialog_expressionbuilder.html#text')">text expression</a>.</dd>
