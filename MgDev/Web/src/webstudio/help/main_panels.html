<h1>Panels</h1>
<p>The Web Studio interface separates functionality into 'panels'.  Panels are stacked vertically on the left and the right hand side of the application.  On the left side, there are two panels: <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('panel_siteexplorer.html')">Site Explorer</a> and <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('panel_openresources.html')">Open Resources</a>.  On the right hand site, the panels reflect the current open resource.</p>
<p>All panels work in the same way.  Each panel has:</p>
<ul>
    <li><img src="images/loading.gif" width="20" height="20"> A busy indicator, which is visible when the panel is waiting for asynchronous content to load.</li>
    <li>A title.</li>
    <li><img src="images/icon_quickhelp.png" width="20" height="20"> An optional help icon which opens the embedded help system with a help page for the appropriate panel.</li>
    <li><img src="images/icon_minimize.png" width="20" height="20"> A minimize icon which will collapse the panel.  When a panel is collapsed, its space is given to the next available panel above the one that is collapsed.  If no panel is open above the one that is collapsed, then a panel will be opened.  The exception to this rule is the top-most panel, which will give its space to a panel below it.</li>
    <li><img src="images/icon_maximize.png" width="20" height="20"> A maximize icon, which will expand the panel to take up all available space and will collapse all other panels.</li>
    <li><img src="images/icon_close.png" width="20" height="20"> An optional close icon, which is used on the right hand side in the top most panel to close an open resource.</li>
</ul>
