<h1>Style Line Dialog</h1>
<p>The style line dialog is opened when you click on a style preview in the Layer Styles panel and the geometric type of the feature class is line.  The style line dialog allows you to build and manage composite line styles.</p>
<h2>Composite Lines</h2>
<p>Line styles are unique in that it is possible to define multiple lines as part of a single style.  This provides the capability to create advanced cartographic representations such as casement-style roads.  Composite lines are managed through the composite line toolbar in this dialog.  Using the toolbar, it is possible to add new lines, duplicate lines, delete lines and manage the order in which the server draws each style.</p>
<p>To have a line layer with no style, simply remove all the lines.</p>
<p>Lines are drawn in order from top to bottom.  This means you should place wider lines at the top and narrower lines lower down.</p>
<p>To edit the style of a single line, click the line to select it and adjust its properties in the Line Style form below.</p>
