<p>The site explorer is a tree view control that allows you to browse the MapGuide Open Source site repository.  When you first connect to a MapGuide Open Source site, the site explorer connects to the site and retrieves a list of resources within the top level folder of the repository.  When you click on a [+] next to a folder, the site explorer connects to the server to retrieve the contents of that folder.  This ensures that you are always seeing the most current contents of any particular folder.</p>
