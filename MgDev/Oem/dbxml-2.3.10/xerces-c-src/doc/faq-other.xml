  <faq title="Are the Xerces parsers Year-2000-compliant?">
        <q>Are the Xerces parsers Year-2000-compliant?</q>
        <a>
           	<p>Yes, Xerces-J and Xerces-C are Year 2000 compliant.
		They do not currently use any dates at all (at least until the XML
		Schema date datatypes are fully supported).  However, you may still
		have Y2K problems if the underlying OS or Java implementation has
		problems with dates past year 2000 (e.g. OS calls which accept or
		return year numbers).</p>
		<p>Most (UNIX) systems store dates internally as signed 32-bit
		integers which contain the number of seconds since 1st January 1970,
		so the magic boundary to worry about is the year 2038 and not 2000.
		But modern operating systems shouldn't cause any trouble at all.</p>
		
		<p>The Apache Xerces project is an open-source software product
		of the Apache Software Foundation. The project and the Foundation

		of the software for your application. There are several commercial
		support organizations and derivative products available that may be
		able to certify the software and provide you with any assurances you

  <faq title="How do I determine the version of &XercesCName; I am using?">
        <q>How do I determine the version of &XercesCName; I am using?</q>
        <a>

           <p>The version string for &XercesCName; is in one of the header files. Look
           inside the file <code>src/xercesc/util/XercesVersion.hpp</code> or, in the binary distribution,
           look in <code>include/xercesc/utils/XercesVersion.hpp</code>. </p>

           <p>If you don't have the header files, you have to find the version
           information from the shared library name. On Windows right click on
           the DLL name &XercesCWindowsDLL;.dll in the bin directory and look up
           properties. The version information may be found on the Version tab.</p>

           <p>On AIX, just look for the library name &XercesCUnixLib;&XercesCUnixSoName;.so (or
           &XercesCUnixLib;.so.&XercesCUnixSoName; on Solaris/Linux
           and &XercesCUnixLib;.sl.&XercesCUnixSoName; on HP-UX). The
           version number is indicated in the name of the library.</p>

  <faq title="I can't use C++. Do you have a Java version?">

    <q>I can't use C++. Do you have a Java version?</q>

    <a>

      <p>Yes. The Xerces family of products also has a Java version. More
        information is available at:

    <q>Where can I find additional information on XML?</q>

    <a>

    <p>The Web. <jump href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xml.html">
      http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xml.html</jump> is an excellent place to start,
      with links to overviews, FAQs, specifications, industry news, applications and
      other software, related standards, etc.</p>

  <faq title="Does &XercesCName; support XPath?">

    <q> Does &XercesCName; support XPath?</q>

    <a>

      <p>No.  The &XercesCName; &XercesCVersion; only has partial XPath implementation
         for the purposes of handling Schema identity constraints.  For full XPath
         support, you can refer
         <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/overview.html">Apache Xalan C++</jump> or
         other Open Source Projects like
         <jump href="http://software.decisionsoft.com">Pathan</jump>.
