    <s2 title="Windows NT/2000">
      <s3 title="Source distribution">
        <p>The &XercesCName; source is available in the source distribution.
        </p>
        <p>Install the &XercesCName; source distribution by using <code>unzip</code>
		on the &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.zip archive in the Windows environment. You can
		use WinZip, or any other UnZip utility.</p>
<source>unzip &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.zip</source>
        <p>This creates a &apos;&XercesCSrcInstallDir;&apos; sub-directory
		containing the &XercesCName; source distribution. </p>

        <p>If you need to build the &XercesCName; source after installation,
        please follow the <jump href="build.html">Build Instructions</jump>.</p>

      </s3>
      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
        <p>Install the &XercesCName; binary distribution by using <code>unzip</code>
		on the &XercesCInstallDir;-win32.zip archive in the Windows environment. You can
		use WinZip, or any other UnZip utility.</p>
<source>unzip &XercesCInstallDir;-win32.zip</source>
        <p>This creates a &apos;&XercesCInstallDir;-win32&apos; sub-directory
		containing the &XercesCName; binary distribution. </p>

        <p>You need to add the &apos;&XercesCInstallDir;-win32\bin&apos;
		directory to your path: </p>

        <p>To do this under Windows NT, go to the start menu, click the
		settings menu and select control panel. When the control panel opens,
		double click on System and select the &apos;Environment&apos; tab.
		Locate the PATH variable under system variables
        and add &lt;full_path_to_&XercesCInstallDir;>\bin to the PATH variable.
		To do this under Windows 2000 add this line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:</p>
<source>SET PATH=&lt;full_path_to_&XercesCInstallDir;>\bin;%PATH%</source>
		<p>or run the <code>SET PATH</code> command in your shell window.</p>

        <p>Besides, if the parser is built with icu message loader (like IBM XML4C binaries),
        or message catalog loader, then you need to create a new environment variable, XERCESC_NLS_HOME
        to point to the directory, $XERCESCROOT/msg, where the message files reside.</p>           
<source>SET XERCESC_NLS_HOME=&lt;full_path_to_&XercesCInstallDir;>\msg</source>
           
        <p>The binary distribution has the built parser library and some samples executables.
           Please refer to the <jump href="samples.html">Samples</jump> for how to run the samples.</p>

        <p>The &XercesCName; source is available in the source distribution.
        </p>
        <p>Install the &XercesCName; source distribution &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz by extracting the files
           from the compressed archive.</p>
<source>
gunzip &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz
tar &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar
</source>
        <p>This creates a &apos;&XercesCSrcInstallDir;&apos; sub-directory
		containing the &XercesCName; source distribution. </p>

        <note>On Solaris, please use <code>gtar</code> instead of tar. &install-faq-distrib11;</note>

        <p>If you need to build the &XercesCName; source after installation,
        please follow the <jump href="build.html">Build Instructions</jump>.</p>

      </s3>
      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
        <p>Install the binary distribution &XercesCInstallDir;-xxx.tar.gz by extracting the files
           from the compressed archive; where &apos;xxx&apos; is the corresponding UNIX platform.
           For example:</p>
<source>
gunzip &XercesCInstallDir;-linux.tar.gz
tar -xvf &XercesCInstallDir;-linux.tar
</source>
        <p>This will create an '&XercesCInstallDir;-linux' sub-directory
		containing the &XercesCName; binary distribution. </p>

        <note>On Solaris, please use <code>gtar</code> instead of tar. &install-faq-distrib11;</note>

        <p>You will need to add the
        &XercesCInstallDir;-linux/bin directory to your PATH environment variable:</p>

        <p>For Bourne Shell, K Shell or Bash, type: </p>
<source>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/&XercesCInstallDir;-linux/bin"</source>
		<p>For C Shell, type:</p>
<source>setenv PATH "$PATH:$HOME/&XercesCInstallDir;-linux/bin"</source>

        <p>If you wish to make this setting permanent, you need to change
		your profile by changing your setup files which can be either .profile or .kshrc.</p>

        <p>In addition, you will also need to set the library search path.
        (LIBPATH on AIX, LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Solaris and Linux, SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX,
        and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X).</p>

        <p>For Bourne Shell, K Shell or Bash, type:</p>
<source>
export LIBPATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LIBPATH (on AIX)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on Solaris, Linux)
export SHLIB_PATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$SHLIB_PATH (on HP-UX)
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (on Mac OS X)</source>

    	<p>For C Shell, type:</p>
<source>
setenv LIBPATH "$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LIBPATH" (on AIX)
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (on Solaris, Linux)
setenv SHLIB_PATH "$XERCESCROOT/lib:$SHLIB_PATH" (on HP-UX)
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH "$XERCESCROOT/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" (Mac OS X)</source>

        <p>Besides, if the parser is built with icu message loader (like IBM XML4C binaries),
        or message catalog loader, then you need to create a new environment variable, XERCESC_NLS_HOME
        to point to the directory, $XERCESCROOT/msg, where the message files reside.</p>                     
<source>
export XERCESC_NLS_HOME=$XERCESCROOT/msg
or
setenv XERCESC_NLS_HOME=$XERCESCROOT/msg
</source>

      <s3 title="Binary distribution">
		  <p>Install the binary distribution by running
			  <jump href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</jump> setup.exe.
			  When you reach the "Packages" step of the Cygwin Setup wizard,
			  expand the "Devel" category, then click in the "New" column next
			  to "xerces-c-devel" until it reads "&XercesCVersion;-X".</p>

		  <p>This will install the necessary libraries and include files
			  for the &XercesCName; binary distribution.</p>

		  <p>If you wish to run programs linked to &XercesCName; that were
			  built in the Cygwin environment, you need to add your Cygwin
			  "bin" directory to your Windows PATH environment variable.
			  In typical Cygwin installations, the bin directory is in the
			  Cygwin directory on the drive that windows is installed on.
			  For instance, if windows is installed to C:\WINNT\System32,
			  Your Cygwin bin directory may be "C:\cygwin\bin".</p>

		  <p>The binary distribution has the built parser library.  Sample
			  executables may be available in a future release on the
			  Cygwin platform.  In the meantime, they may be built from the
			  source distribution by following the
			  <jump href="build.html">Build Instructions</jump> for
			  "Building samples".</p>
