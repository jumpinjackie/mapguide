This directory and the tools here are used to generate Windows
project files for the main XQilla library and related projects.

Both VC6 and Visual Studio 7.1 files are generated.  The
latter can be opened using Visual Studio 2005 (8) as
well.

The process:

1.  Source (including header) files are added to the file,
    srcfiles.in.  See that file for format.
    Be sure to update that file when files are added or removed
    from the project.

2.  Run the script, s_win32, which calls the 2 scripts, s_win32_dsp
    and s_win32_vcproj to generate project files.  These files
    land in ../Win32Projects/{VC6,VC7.1}

The scripts must be run on a Unix-style machine, most likely,
as they use bash and commands that are typicall available
on Unix.  They *may* run under cygwin.

Do not ever manually edit the output project files (*.dsp,
*.vcproj).  If changes are required, edit the templates
and scripts and generate the changed projects.

Details:

The scripts use template project files (ending in ".src")
and do a lot of field substitution from configuration found
in these files:
   lib_paths.sed
   s_win32_*

Todo:

1.  Generate srcfiles.in from Makefile.am to remove multiple
manual steps
