		Berkeley DB XML Examples README

This directory contains example code for the
language bindings supported by BDB XML, including
C++, Java, and Python.  Examples for PHP and Perl are
in their corresponding src subdirectories (see src/php
and src/perl).

This is a brief overview of the example structure:

cxx/gettingStarted
java/gettingStarted
	These are examples associated with the C++ and
	Java Getting Started Guide documentation provided
	with BDB XML.

cxx/basic
java/basic
python/basic
	Simple examples of BDB XML usage:
	helloWorld -- as basic as it gets
	helloWorldTxn -- basic, with transactions
	query -- simple query and results handling
	queryTxn -- simple query and results handling using transactions
	... need a couple more

TBD add "advanced" directory (cxx/advanced, ...)
	o indexes
	o use of checkpoints
	o deadlock handling
	o app server example
	o scripting integration with other stuff???
