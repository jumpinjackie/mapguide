Fusion Installation Instructions

About Fusion
------------

Fusion is a toolkit for building web-mapping applications on top of
MapGuide Open Source/Enterprise (MGOS/E).

Pre-requisites
--------------

You must first obtain and correctly install MGOS/E and one of the
Web Server Extension API languages.  Currently, Fusion only supports
PHP.

Once you have a working MapGuide OS/E installation with PHP API
extensions, you can install Fusion.

Obtaining Fusion
----------------

Fusion is available from .....

Installing Fusion
-----------------

NOTE: It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you install Fusion inside the
WebServerExtensions/www directory of your MGOS/E installation.

Fusion must be installed on the same server as your MGOS/E Web Server
Extensions because it uses the API included with the Web Server
Extensions.  

To install Fusion, simply extract your Fusion source code package 
(either tar.gz or zip file).  By default, Fusion is configured to be
installed into the 'www' directory of your WebServerExtensions installation.
You may install Fusion into a different location, as long as you follow
the Configuring Fusion steps below.

Configuring Fusion
------------------

If you installed Fusion into the WebServerExtensions/www directory, and your
WebServerExtensions are installed in C:\Program Files, Fusion is ready to
go.

If the Web Server Extensions are installed elsewhere, you must now 
change the default values in the following file:

fusion/mapguide/php/Common.php

At the beginning of this file are two lines as follows:

$defaultInstallDir = "C:/Program Files/MapGuideOpenSource/";
$defaultExtensionDir = $installDir . "WebServerExtensions/www/";

Modify these lines to point to your actual installation path.

If Fusion is not installed inside the WebServerExtensions/www directory,
you must configure your web server to provide web access to Fusion.

Doing this is dependent on the actual web server you have installed.  You 
need to set up alias (Apache) or virtual directory (IIS) to the 'fusion'
directory and configure it to allow execution of PHP scripts.

If you do not know how to configure your web server to do this, please
move the 'fusion' directory to the WebServerExtensions/www directory.

Testing your Installation
-------------------------

Fusion comes with some sample applications in the samples directory.  To
test your Fusion installation, you need to modify these applications for
your particular setup and then load the applications.  If you get a map,
everything is good!

To configure the sample applications, you need to edit the following files:

* index.html

  look for the <script> tag that includes fusion.js and modify the url
  appropriately.  It is configured to use localhost:8008, which will 
  work for local installations of MGOS/E
  
* redirect.php

  the sample applications use the Anonymous user by default.  If you have
  modified MGOS/E default user configuration or would like to use a
  different user name and password (for instance, if you need a user
  that has the Author role), then you can modify the $username and
  $password variables near the top of this file.  Note that these values
  are not accessible to the user of the application (see Fusion Developer's
  guide for more details on why redirect.php is needed and what it does).
  
* WebLayout.xml

  the sample applications are configured to load the Sheboygan sample
  map that is freely available with MGOS/E.  If you do not have this
  sample data set installed, have installed it in a different location
  than the default, or simply wish to use a different map, you will need
  to edit this file.  Look for the following block:
  
  <Command xsi:type="MapCommandType">
      <Name>Map</Name>
      <Label>Map</Label>
      <TargetViewer>All</TargetViewer>
      <Action>MGMap</Action>
      <ResourceId>Library://Samples/Sheboygan/Maps/Sheboygan.MapDefinition</ResourceId>
  </Command>
  
  Change the ResourceId tag to point to the appropriate MapDefinition.
