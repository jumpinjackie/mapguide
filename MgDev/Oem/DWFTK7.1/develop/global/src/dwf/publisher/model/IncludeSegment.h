///\brief           A segment class for defining visual elements that can be referenced throughout the scene.
///\since           7.0.1
///
///                 An include segment is simply a "regular" segment that is defined in the include library
///                 rather than the scene graph.  These segments are exactly like the scene segments except
///                 that they are not part of the scene directly.  Rather they must be referenced, or included,
///                 in the scene via the \a DWFSegment::include() methods. 
///
///                 This class, as part of the \ref dwfpublish3d also may contribute to the metadata of the DWF.
///                 Currently all include segments must be named; and this name is not arbitrary.  The include
///                 segment name may be used as the object node in the DWF object structure.
///                 When a segment is included in another segment that is named (that is, a segment that itself
///                 is an object node), the included segment contributes its graphics to the scene
///                 but only the properties of the included object are applied to the referencing node.  
///                 When a segment is included in another segment that is unnamed, the included segment
///                 creates a node in the object hierarchy.
