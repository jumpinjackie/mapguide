DESCRIPTION
-----------

This Perl module provides an interface to the Sleepycay library, DbXml.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build this module you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.6.1 or greater.

    * A C++ Compiler that is compatible with the C compiler that was
      used to build your Perl binary. This usually means that the C & C++
      compilers come from the same vendor and are compatible versions.
      Alternatively, if you can manage to build Perl using your C++
      compiler, use the same one to build this module.

    * The DbXml C++ library version 2.0 or greater.
      Berkeley DB Version 4.3.27 or greater

      The official web site for Berkeley DB and DbXml is 
      
          http://www.sleepycat.com


BUILDING THE MODULE ON UNIX PLATFORMS
-------------------------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, follow the steps below:

Step 1 : Edit the file config to suit you local installation.
         Instructions are given in the file.

Step 2 : Build and test the module using this sequence of commands:

             perl Makefile.PL
             make
             make test

BUILDING THE MODULE ON WINDOWS
-------------------------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, follow the steps below:

Step 1 : If you are using a version of Visual Studio, you
     need to have nmake.exe and cl.exe in your PATH.
     This can usually be accomplished by running
     the script, vcvars32.bat.  This script is in the MSVC
     distribution, perhaps in the directory,
     <path_to_msvc_installation>\VC7\bin\vcvars32.bat.
     Running this script sets up the necessary environment.	 

Step 2 : Verify the configuration:
     Edit config.win32 to make sure that the paths to the
     libraries, and the library names are correct for your
     installation.
     
Step 3 : Build and test the module using this sequence of commands:

     perl Makefile.PL -config config.win32
     nmake
     cd Db
     nmake test
     cd ..\DbXml
     nmake test

INSTALLATION
------------

UNIX:
    make install
Windows:
    nmake install

How to report a problem with Sleepycat::DbXml.
----------------------------------------------

If you are having problems building this module, send me *all* of the
following:

1. The version of this module. If you don't know, run this command to 
   find out

        grep VERSION DbXml/DbXml.pm

2. The complete output from running Perl -V.

3. The name and version of the C++ compiler you are using. If you are
   running g++, this will tell you

        g++ --version

4. A copy of the config file.

5. A *complete* log of what happend when you tried to build the
   module. I need everything from the point when you run this

       perl Makefile.PL

   in the root directory of this module.    

6. Are you building the module in the dbxml source tree, i.e. in the
   directory src/perl?

7. The version of the dbxml library you are using.

8. The version of the pathan library you are using.

9. The version of the Xerces library you are using.

10. The version of the Berkeley DB library you are using.
