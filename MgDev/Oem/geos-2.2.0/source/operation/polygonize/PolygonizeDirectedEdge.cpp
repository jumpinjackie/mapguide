 * Revision 1.3  2004/10/13 10:03:02  strk
 * Added missing linemerge and polygonize operation.
 * Bug fixes and leaks removal from the newly added modules and

 * Some comments and indentation changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/07/02 13:28:29  strk
 * Fixed all #include lines to reflect headers layout change.
 * Added client application build tips in README.
