 * Supports creating a new Geometry which is a modification of an existing one.
 * Geometry objects are intended to be treated as immutable.
 * This class allows you to "modify" a Geometry
 * by traversing it and creating a new Geometry with the same overall
 * structure but possibly modified components.
 *
 * The following kinds of modifications can be made:
 *
 * - the values of the coordinates may be changed.
 *   Changing coordinate values may make the result Geometry invalid;
 *   this is not checked by the GeometryEditor
 * - the coordinate lists may be changed
 *   (e.g. by adding or deleting coordinates).
 * The modifed coordinate lists must be consistent with their original parent component
 * (e.g. a LinearRing must always have at least 4 coordinates, and the first and last
 * coordinate must be equal)
 * <li>components of the original geometry may be deleted
 * (e.g. holes may be removed from a Polygon, or LineStrings removed from a MultiLineString).
 * Deletions will be propagated up the component tree appropriately.
 * </ul>
 * Note that all changes must be consistent with the original Geometry's structure
 * (e.g. a Polygon cannot be collapsed into a LineString).
 * <p>
 * The resulting Geometry is not checked for validity.
 * If validity needs to be enforced, the new Geometry's #isValid should be checked.
