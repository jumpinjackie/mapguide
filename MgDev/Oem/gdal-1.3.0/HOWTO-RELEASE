	Notes on Preparing a GDAL Source Release
	========================================

1) Update the release date, and number information in gcore/gdal_version.h.

2) Update the VERSION file.

3) Update LIBGDAL_CURRENT/REVISION/AGE macros in GDALmake.opt.in.
   - For a release with no interface changes just bump REVISION. 
   - Adding interfaces, bump CURRENT/AGE, set REVISION to 0. 
   - Deleting interfaces / compatibility issues - bump CURRENT, others to zero.

4) Prepare release overview in the NEWS file.  The cvs2cl.pl script can be 
   useful for collecting a full listing of all CVS log entries.  It can be
   useful to perform this and some of the other cvs intensive steps on 
   remotesensing.org if possible, to minimize CVS latency. 

   eg. 

   % cvs2cl.pl > AutoChangeLog

5) Update the GDAL doc/index_raw.html to refer to the 
   newly to be created version, and commit. 

5.5) Place Release notice in ChangeLog file. 

6) Tag the release set in CVS: 

   eg. 
   % cvs tag -F gdal_1_1_6 

6.5) Also tag the "autotest" tree as above.

7) Create the source distributions using the mkgdaldist.sh script.  The
   argument should be the version number (ie. 1.1.6).  Hit enter when 
   prompted for a CVS password.

   eg.
   % mkgdaldist.sh 1.1.6

8) Publish the resulting files on ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal, 
   gdal.maptools.org/dl and ftp.gdal.org/htdocs/dl.

9) Announce release to the gdal-dev@remotesensing.org, and freegis@freegis.org.

10) Update the freshmeat.net entry for GDAL.
