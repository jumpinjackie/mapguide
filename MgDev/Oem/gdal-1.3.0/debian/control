Description: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
 GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats.
 As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the
 calling application for all supported formats. The related OGR
 library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides
 a similar capability for simple features vector data.
 .
 GDAL supports 40+ popular data formats, including commonly used
 ones (GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG and more) as well as the ones used in
 GIS and remote sensing software packages (ERDAS Imagine,
 ESRI Arc/Info, ENVI, PCI Geomatics). Also supported many remote
 sensing and scientific data distribution formats such as HDF,
 EOS FAST, NOAA L1B, NetCDF, FITS.
 .
 OGR library supports popular vector formats like ESRI Shapefile,
 TIGER data, S57, MapInfo File, DGN, GML and more.
 .
 This package contains shared library.
