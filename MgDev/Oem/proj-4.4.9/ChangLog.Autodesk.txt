TUX147-WCW09: Fix Proj4 runtime error


With CPL and OGR, I had to make a few minor changes to the makefiles since they 
were both generating the same PDB - gdal.pdb - in the same folder.  Now they 
create cpl.pbd and ogr.pdb in the correct folders.

- run MT tool to add manifest to DLL

TUX147-WCW11: Fix memory leaks in PROJ4


Running the PROJ4-based coordinate system unit test uncovered numerous leaks in 
PROJ4 itself.  I tracked down all the leaked allocations we ran into and fixed 
the code.

There were two basic problems:

1/ A couple of the projection objects would needlessly allocate an array of
   doubles two times (duplicate calls to pj_enfn).

2/ One of the projections was making a call to pj_authset (which returns an
   array of doubles) and not freeing it.  It was also not initializing the
   pointer member for this array in its setup call.  Bad, bad, bad.


//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/PJ_eqdc.c
//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/PJ_gn_sinu.c
- remove duplicate calls to pj_enfn()

//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/PJ_laea.c
- ensure P->apa member variable gets initialized to 0
- free data allocated in pj_authset()

TUX147-WCW12: Fix PROJ4 project issues


The PROJ4 library we were generating had a couple of issues:

1/ Even though it generated a PDB, you couldn't debug into the PROJ4 library.
   I discovered this while tracking down the leaks.  The problem was that the
   makefile was missing the /Zi compiler option.  Without this option the PDB
   that gets generated is unusable.

2/ To make things easier the next time we rebuild PROJ4, I updated the project
   file to only build the proj_i.lib target.  There's no need to generate static
   library or the EXEs.

//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/makefile.vc
- fix compiler settings to produce correct PDB

//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/PROJ4.sln (added)
//MgDev/Oem/proj-4.4.9/src/PROJ4.vcproj
- only build the proj_i.lib target

Tux149-TIS03: Change exec bit on configure scripts for gdal and proj


Changed the executable flag (in Perforce) for the configure scripts of gdal and 
proj. This avoids the step of having to change file attributes before building 
those two libraries.
