            Transactionally protecting your container operations is an important
            ingredient to ensuring the integrity of your containers and
            databases. However, be aware that transactions may impact your
            application's performance.

            The <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference Guide</i>
            contains a couple of sections that can help you understand the
            performance impact transactions can have on your application.

            The next several section in this guide provides a rough introduction
            to this information.
        </p>
      <p>
            There are two areas of consideration where it comes to transactional
            performance. The first is disk I/O and the second has to do with
            lock contention.
        </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="txnio"></a>Transaction Disk I/O</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
        <p>
                Normally when you perform a write to a BDB XML container, the
                write is not written to disk until a sync is called on the
                in-memory cache. This syncing occurs either when you force it by
                using 
                    
                    <span><tt class="methodname">DbEnv.sync</tt>,</span>
                or when your
                environment is closed. (Note that you can suppress the sync when
                you close your environment, but this is not the normal case.)
            </p>
        <p>
                When you transactionally protect your database writes, however,
                the data modified by the write is written to disk every time the
                transaction is committed. For applications that run for
                extremely long periods of time, and which perform relatively few
                write operations, this can will improve your
                application's performance because the commit only writes those
                portions of the cache that were dirtied (written) by the
                transaction. A full sync, on the other hand, writes the entire
                cache to disk which is considerably more expensive than the
                partial write performed by a commit.

        <p>
            Because transactions guarantee isolation from all other threads of
            control, they must perform locking, and hold those locks for the
            duration of the transaction. Holding these locks may cause other
            thread of control to have to wait in order to be able to access the
            locked data. How much this affects your application will depend on
            its data access patterns.
         </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, with transactional applications, it is possible that
            conflicting lock requests from different threads of control can
            cause a deadlock to occur. To understand more about deadlocks and
            how to handle them, please refer to the 
            <i class="citetitle">Deadlock detection</i> section of the 
            <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference Guide</i>
            (available at: 
            <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/transapp/deadlock.html" target="_top">http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/transapp/deadlock.html</a>).
         </p>
        <p>
            The performance penalty that you might pay due to the additional
            locking required by your transactions is dependent on a number of
            factors:
         </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    The amount of time that your transaction lives. If your
                    transaction is short-lived (the ideal situation), then there
                    is less chance that it will be holding a lock required by
                    another transaction.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    The number of operations performed by the transaction. A
                    transaction that must read and write hundreds of documents
                    will hold considerably more locks for potentially longer
                    periods of time than an application that reads and writes
                    only a few documents.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    The number of transactions (typically this means threads of
                    control) in existence at any given time. The more
                    transactions there are, the greater the chance for deadlock
                    contention.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Given this, for best results try to use only short-lived
            transactions. Also, try to keep the number of operations performed
            by your transactions small, or try to keep the number of
            transactions in existence small. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>

        </div>
        <p>
            One final thing to consider when using transactions with BDB XML has
            to do with re-indexing containers. If you are performing index add,
            delete, or replace operations on a very large container (tens of
            thousands of documents or greater), and you are using transactions 
            to protect these operations, then the operation can potentially fail 
            with the following error message:
		</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>
			</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">Lock table is out of available locks</pre>
            <p>
		</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            When you perform an index operation on a container, you are reading
            and writing every document node in the container. This means that you are
            asking Berkeley DB to read and write every record in the underlying
            database.
		</p>
        <p>
            Every time Berkeley DB performs a read or a write operation, it
            acquires one or more locks on the database pages on which it is
            operating. Normally, Berkeley DB releases those locks once it has
            completed the operation. However, as discussed above, when you 
            use transactions to protect write operations, Berkeley DB holds 
            all locks that it acquires until the transaction completes 
            (is either committed or aborted).
		</p>
        <p>
            Locks are a finite resource, and so Berkeley DB maintains an
            internal data structure that identifies how many locks it can use at
            any given time. By default, this number is 1,000 locks.
		</p>
        <p>
            The end result is, if you are performing index operations on large
            containers and you are using transactions to protect those
            operations, you can run out of locks. When this happens, Berkeley DB
            fails the operation with the above noted error message.
		</p>
        <p>
			To work around this problem, you must increase the number of locks 
            available to Berkeley DB. You do this with 
                
                <span><tt class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.setMaxLocks()</tt>.</span>
