        Welcome to Berkeley DB XML (BDB XML). BDB XML is an embedded
        database specifically designed for the storage and retrieval of 
        XML-formatted documents.  Built on the award-winning Berkeley DB,
        BDB XML provides for efficient queries against millions of XML documents
        using XQuery.  XQuery is a query language designed for the examination and
        retrieval of portions of XML documents.
	</p>
      <p>
        This document introduces BDB XML. It is intended to provide a rapid
        introduction to the BDB XML API set and related concepts.  The goal of
        this document is to provide you with an efficient mechanism with which
        you can evaluate BDB XML against your project's technical requirements.
        As such, this document is intended for <span>Java</span>
        developers and senior software architects who are looking for an
        in-process XML data management solution. No prior experience with
        BDB XML is expected or required.
	</p>
      <p>
		Note that while this document uses 
        
        <span>Java</span> 
        for its examples, the concepts described here should
		apply equally to all language bindings in which the BDB XML API is available. 
        Be aware that a version of this document also exists for the 
        
        <span>C++</span> 
        language.

        <p>
			BDB XML is an embedded database that is tuned for managing and querying hundreds,
			thousands, or even millions of XML documents. You use BDB XML through a programming 
            API that allows you to manage, query, and modify your documents via
            an in-process database engine. Because BDB XML is an embedded
            engine, you 
                
                <span>use it with</span>
            your application in the same was as you would any third-party
                
                <span>package.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            In BDB XML documents are stored in <span class="emphasis"><em>containers</em></span>,
            which you create and manage using <code class="classname">XmlManager</code>
            objects. Each such object can open multiple containers at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each container can hold millions of documents. For each document
            placed in a container, the container holds all the document data, 
            any metadata that you have created for the document, and 
            any indices maintained for the documents in the container.
        </p>
        <p>
            (<span class="emphasis"><em>Metadata</em></span> is information that you associate with
            your document that might not readily fit into the document schema
            itself. For example, you might use metadata to track the last time a
            document was modified instead of maintaining that information from
            within the actual document.)
        </p>
        <p>
            XML documents may be stored in BDB XML containers in one of two ways:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    Whole documents.
                </p>
              <p>
                    Documents are stored in their entirety. This method works
                    best for smaller documents (that is, documents under a megabyte in size).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    As document nodes.
                </p>
              <p>
                    Documents stored as nodes are broken down into their
                    individual document element nodes and each such node is then
                    stored as an individual record in the container. Along with
                    each such record, BDB XML also stores all node attributes,
                    and the text nodes, if any.
                </p>
              <p>
                    This type of storage is best for large XML documents
                    (greater than 1 megabyte in size).
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            From an API-usage perspective, there are very few differences
            between whole document and node storage containers. For more
            information, see 
            <a class="xref" href="containers.html#containertypes" title="Container Types">Container Types</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a document has been placed in a container, you can use XQuery
            to retrieve one or more documents. You can also use XQuery to
            retrieve one or more portions of one or more documents. 
            Queries are performed using <code class="classname">XmlManager</code>
            objects.  The queries themselves, however, limit the scope 
            of the query to a specified list of containers or documents.
            documents. 
        </p>
        <p>
            BDB XML supports the entire XQuery specification. You can read
            the specification here:
        </p>
        <p>
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/" target="_top">http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, because XQuery is an extension to XPath 2.0, BDB XML
            provides full support for that query language as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, BDB XML provides a robust document modification facility
            that allows you to easily add, delete, or modify selected portions
            of documents. This means you can avoid writing modification code
            that manipulates (for example) DOM trees — BDB XML can handle
            all those details for you.
        </p>
        <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="benefits"></a>Benefits</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                BDB XML provides a series of features that makes it more
                suitable for storing XML documents than other common XML storage
                mechanisms. BDB XML's ability to provide efficient indexed
                queries means that it is a far more efficient storage mechanism
                than simply storing XML data in the filesystem. And because
                BDB XML provides the same transaction protection as does
                Berkeley DB, it is a much safer choice than is the filesystem
                for applications that might have multiple simultaneous readers
                and writers of the XML data.
		    </p>
          <p>
                More, because BDB XML stores XML data in its native format,
                BDB XML enjoys the same extensible schema that has attracted
                many developers to XML. It is this flexibility that makes
                BDB XML a better choice than relational database offerings that
                must translate XML data into internal tables and rows, thus
                locking the data into a relational database schema.

				BDB XML is implemented to conform to the W3C standards for XML,
                XML Namespaces, and the XQuery working draft.
				In addition, it offers the following features specifically designed to support XML
				data management and queries:
			</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
							Containers. A container is a single file that contains one or more
							XML documents, and their metadata and indices. You
                            use containers to add, delete, and modify documents,
                            and to manage indices. 
					</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
							Indices. BDB XML indices greatly enhance the performance of queries against
							the corresponding XML data set. BDB XML indices are based on the structure of
							your XML documents, and as such you declare indices based on the nodes that
							appear in your documents as well the data that appears on those nodes.
					</p>
                <p>
                            Note that you can also declare indices against
                            metadata.
                    </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
							Queries. BDB XML queries are performed using the
                            XQuery 1.0 language. XQuery is a
							W3C draft specification 
                            (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/" target="_top">http://www.w3.org/XML/Query</a>).
					</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
							Query results. BDB XML retrieves documents that
                            match a given XQuery query.
							BDB XML query results are always returned as a set. The set can contain either
							matching documents, or a set of values from those matching documents.
					</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
							Storage. If you use node-level storage for you
                            documents (see 
                            <a class="xref" href="containers.html#containertypes" title="Container Types">Container Types</a>), 
                            then BDB XML
                            automatically transcodes your documents to Unicode
                            UTF-8. If you use whole document storage, then the
                            document is stored in whatever encoding that it
                            uses. Note that in either case, your documents must
                            use an encoding supported by Xerces before they can
                            be stored in BDB XML containers.
					</p>
                <p>
							Beyond the encoding, documents are stored (and retrieved) in 
                            their native format with all whitespace preserved.
					</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
							Metadata attribute support. Each document stored in BDB XML can have metadata
							attributes associated with it. This allows information to be associated with
							the document without actually storing that information in the document. For
							example, metadata attributes might identify the last accessed and last
							modified timestamps for the document.
					</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Document modification. BDB XML provides a robust
                            mechanism for modifying documents. Using this
                            mechanism, you can add, replace, and delete nodes 
                            from your document. This mechanism allows you to
                            modify both element and attribute nodes, as well as
                            processing instructions and comments.
                    </p>

                Beyond XML-specific features, BDB XML inherits a great many
                features from Berkeley DB, which allows BDB XML to provide the
                same fast, reliable, and scalable database support as does
                Berkeley DB. The result is that BDB XML is an ideal candidate
                for mission-critical applications that must manage XML data.

                        In-process data access. BDB XML is compiled in the same way as
                        any library. It runs in the same process space as your
                        application. The result is database support in a small
                        footprint without the IPC-overhead required by
                        traditional client/server-based database
                        implementations.

                        Database environment support. BDB XML environments
                        support all of the same features as Berkeley DB
                        environments, including multiple databases,
                        transactions, deadlock detection, lock and page control,
                        and encryption.  In particular, this means that BDB XML
                        databases can share an environment with Berkeley DB
                        databases, thus allowing an application to gracefully
                        use both.

                <p>
                        Atomic operations. Complex sequences of read and write
                        access can be grouped together into a single atomic
                        operation using BDB XML's transaction support.  Either
                        all of the read and write operations within a
                        transaction succeed, or none of them succeed.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                        Isolated operations. Operations performed inside a
                        transaction see all XML documents as if no other
                        transactions are currently operating on them.

              <li>
                <p>
                        Recoverability. BDB XML's transaction support ensures
                        that all committed data is available no matter how the
                        application or system might subsequently fail.

                            Concurrent access. Through the combined use of
                            isolation mechanisms built into BDB XML, plus
                            deadlock handling supplied by the application,
                            multiple threads and processes can concurrently
                            access the XML data set in a safe manner.

				The official BDB XML distribution provides the library in the
                C++, Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Tcl
				languages. Because BDB XML is available under an open source license, a growing list
				of third-parties are providing BDB XML support in languages other than those that are
				officially supported.

          <p>
                BDB XML is supported on a very large number of platforms.  Check
                with the BDB XML mailing lists for the latest news on supported
                platforms, as well as for information as to whether your
                preferred language provides BDB XML support.
