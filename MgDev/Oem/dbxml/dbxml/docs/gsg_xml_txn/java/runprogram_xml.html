        The examples presented in this chapter allow you to manipulate certain runtime characteristics that will affect
        the number of deadlocks the program will encounter. You can modify:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                The number of threads the program will use to write the container.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                The number of nodes that will be created per document written to the container. The key thing here is
                the size of the documents, as we will see later on in this section.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Whether default isolation is used for the container writes, or if read committed should be used instead.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Whether the container uses wholedoc or node storage.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        The point of the application is to measure the number of deadlocks encountered for a given program run. By
        counting the number of deadlocks, we can get a sense of the overall amount of lock contention occurring in our
        application. Remember that deadlocks represent a race condition 
        that your application lost. In order to occur, two more more threads had to
        have attempted to lock database pages in such a way that the threads blocked waiting for locks that will never
        be released (see <a class="xref" href="blocking_deadlocks.html" title="Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks">Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks</a> for a more complete description).
        So by examining the number of deadlocks that we see, we can indirectly get a sense for the amount of lock
        contention that the application encountered. Roughly speaking, the more deadlocks seen, the more lock contention
        that was going on during the application run.
    </p>
      <p>
        Note that as you modify these constraints, you will see that the program will encounter differing numbers of deadlocks per
        program run. No two program runs will indicate the same number of deadlocks, but changing
        these constraint can on average increase or decrease the number of deadlocks reported by the application.
    </p>
      <p>
        The reason why this application sees deadlocks is because of what BDB XML does under the hood.
        Recall that BDB XML writes XML documents to underlying Berkeley DB databases. Also, recall the Berkeley DB databases are
        usually organized in pages; multiple database entries will exist on any given page. Also, Berkeley DB uses page-level
        locking. The result is that
        multiple XML documents (or portions of XML documents) can and will be stored on the same database
        page. When multiple threads attempt to lock a database page, you get lock contention. When multiple database
        pages are in use and they are locked out of order by the threads of control, you can see deadlocks.
    </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the things that will immediately affect the amount of lock contention our application will encounter
        are:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                Number of threads. If you only ever use a single thread to write to your containers, you will never see any
                lock contention or deadlocks. On the other hand, increasing the number of writer threads will increase the number
                of deadlocks that are reported — up to a point. Recall that deadlocks are the result of losing a
                race condition. As you increase the number of threads in use, your system will slow down due to
                the overhead from context switching. This system slowdown will result in at least a leveling out of the
                number of deadlocks, if not an outright reduction in them. Of course, the point at which this occurs
                depends on the hardware in use.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                XML document size relative to the underlying database page size. The fewer documents that share a
                database page, the less chance there is for lock contention and therefore deadlocks. For our workload, 
                the worse thing you can do is have lots of little database entries and a very large
                page size. Using large documents relative to the page size allows the document to fill up the page,
                which means that, for this example program anyway, there will only ever be one locker for that page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that selecting whole document versus node storage for the container plays into this equation. Whole document storage
                causes the XML document to be written using a single database entry. As a result, the entry itself is
                fairly large and so the underlying page is less likely to be shared by another document (depending on
                document size, of course). Conversely, node storage stores the document's individual nodes as
                individual database entries. Depending on the document, this can result in a lot of tiny database
                entries, which can adversely affect write performance due to increased lock contention. (Of course, 
                the flip side to that is that node
                storage actually improves container query and read performance, but you will have to take our word for
                it because our sample application does not model that behavior.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Isolation level. Recall that by default, Berkeley DB hangs on to all write locks until the transaction either
                commits or aborts. It does this so as to provide your threads of control with the maximum isolation
                protection possible. However, hanging on to write locks like this means that our example application
                will encounter more lock contention and therefore see more deadlocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your application can accept a lessened isolation guarantee, and this one can, then you
                can reduce the isolation so as to reduce the amount of lock contention. In our case, we provide a way to
                use read committed (degree 2) isolation. Read committed causes the transaction to release the write lock 
                as soon as it is finished writing to the page. Since the write locks are held for a shorter amount of
                time, there is less risk of lock contention and, again, deadlocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this workload, using read committed isolation results in a
                dramatic decrease in the reported number of deadlocks, which means that our application is simply
                working more efficiently.
            </p>

      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            By default, the program makes the following choices:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            1
Using node storage:             true
Using read committed:           false </pre>
        <p>
            This represents a worse-case situation for the application in all ways but one; it uses small documents
            that are just one node in size. Running the example three times in a row results in 370, 317, and 382 reported
            deadlocks for an an average of 356.333 deadlocks. Note that your own test results will likely differ
            depending on the number and speed of your CPUs and the speed of your hard drive. For the record, these test
            results were taken using a single CPU PowerPC G3 system with a slow (4200 RPM) laptop hard drive.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="largernodesize"></a>Varying the Node Size</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            With a default node size of 1, we saw an average of 356.333 reported deadlocks over three runs of the
            program. Now lets try increasing the size of the document to see what it does to the number of reported
            deadlocks:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory -n 10
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            10
Using node storage:             true
Using read committed:           false </pre>
        <p>
            This results in 894, 854, and 861 deadlocks for an average of 869.667 reported deadlocks. Clearly the amount
            of lock contention that we are seeing has increased, but why?
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that larger documents should fill up database pages, which should result in less lock contention
            because there are fewer lockers per database page. However, we are using node storage which means that the
            additional nodes results in additional small database entries. Given the way our application is writing
            documents, adding 9 additional nodes per document simply increases the chance of even more documents placing
            nodes on any given page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that there is a limit to the amount of lock contention that this application will see by simply
            adding nodes to the documents it creates. For example, suppose we created documents with 100 nodes:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory -n 100
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            100
Using node storage:             true
Using read committed:           false </pre>
        <p>
            In this case, we see an average of 316 deadlocks — less, even, than the single node case. Why? First,
            the documents are now very large so there is a good chance that each document is filling up entire pages,
            even though we are still using node-level storage. In addition, each thread is now busy creating documents
            and then writing them to the containers, where they are being deconstructed into individual nodes. All of
            this is CPU-intensive activity that is likely helping to prevent lock contention because each thread is
            spending more time on document handling than it does with the smaller document sizes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="usingwholedoc"></a>Using Wholedoc Storage</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            In the previous section we saw that specifying a document node size of 10 resulted in an average of 869.667
            deadlocks across three program runs. This indicates a fairly high level of lock contention. It also
            indicates that the program is not operating particularly efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way we could improve the write throughput for our application is to use whole document storage instead
            of node-level storage. This will result in fewer, but larger, database entries. The result should be fewer
            threads of control fighting for locks on a given page because fewer individual documents will be held on any
            given page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifying a node size of 10 with whole document storage:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory -n 10 -w
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            10
Using node storage:             false
Using read committed:           false </pre>
        <p>
            gives us an average deadlock count of 556 across three program runs. That's certainly a significant
            improvement over node-level storage, although for many workloads you will pay for it in terms of the higher
            query times that wholedoc storage will cost you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="trydegree2"></a>Using Read Committed Isolation</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Another way we can modestly improve our write performance is by using read committed isolation. This causes
            our transactions to release write locks immediately, instead of waiting until the transaction is resolved.
            Using read committed isolation does not gives us the dramatic write performance that does using wholedoc
            storage (see the previous section) but it is still an improvement.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory -n 10 -2
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            10
Using node storage:             true
Using read committed:           true </pre>
        <p>
            The average number of deadlocks seen across three runs with these settings is 724, down from 869.667. This
            is a modest improvement to be sure, but then you do not have to pay the query penalty that wholedoc
            containers might cost you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="degree2wholedoc"></a>Read Committed with Wholedoc Storage</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Finally, the best improvement we can hope to see for this application, using 10 node documents and 5 writer threads, 
            is to use read committed isolation to write to whole document containers.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&gt; java dbxml.txn.TxnGuide -h myEnvironmentDirectory -n 10 -w -2
Number of threads:              5
Number of doc nodes:            10
Using node storage:             true
Using read committed:           true </pre>
        <p>
        For three runs of the program with these settings, we observe 228.333 deadlocks — a remarkable
        improvement over the worst-case 869.667 that we saw for 10 nodes, 5 writer threads!
