        In order to use transactions with your application, you must turn them
        on. To do this you must: 
  </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
            Use an <span>externally-managed</span>
            environment (see <a class="xref" href="enabletxn.html#environments" title="Environments">Environments</a> for details).
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            Turn on transactions for your environment.

            <span>
            You do this by using the
            <code class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.setTransactional()</code>
            method.
            </span>

            

            <span>
                Note that initializing the transactional subsystem implies that
                the logging subsystem is also initialized. Also, note that
                if you do not initialize transactions when you first create
                your environment, then you cannot use transactions for that
                environment after that. This is because BDB XML
                allocates certain structures needed for transactional
                locking that are not available if the environment is
                created without transactional support.

            Initialize the locking subsystem. This is what provides locking for concurrent applications. It also is used
            to perform deadlock detection. See <a class="xref" href="txnconcurrency.html" title="Chapter 4. Concurrency">Concurrency</a>

            Initialize the logging subsystem. While this is enabled by
            default for transactional applications, we suggest that 
            you explicitly initialize it anyway for the purposes of code readability. The logging
            subsystem is what provides your transactional application its durability guarantee, and it is required for
            recoverability purposes. See <a class="xref" href="filemanagement.html" title="Chapter 5. Managing BDB XML Files">Managing BDB XML Files</a>
            for more information.

        All BDB XML applications use environments. However, simple BDB XML
        applications can use a default environment that only provide a small
        subset of features — most notably, multi-threaded access (but not
        multi-process) is enabled, as is the in-memory cache. For more advanced
        features, such as transactional protection, you must use an
        externally-managed environment.
    </p>
        <p>
        An <span class="emphasis"><em>environment</em></span>, represents an
        encapsulation of one or more containers and any associated log and
        region files.  They are used to support multi-threaded 
        and multi-process applications by allowing different threads of
        control to share the in-memory cache, the locking tables, the
        logging subsystem, and the file namespace. By sharing these things,
        your concurrent application is more efficient than if each thread
        of control had to manage these resources on its own.
    </p>
        <p>
        By default all BDB XML containers are backed by files on disk.  In
        addition to these files, transactional BDB XML applications create
        logs that are also by default stored on disk (they can optionally
        be backed using shared memory). Finally, transactional
        BDB XML applications also create and use shared-memory regions that
        are also typically backed by the filesystem. But like containers and
        logs, the regions can be maintained strictly in-memory if your
        application requires it. For an example of an application that
        manages all environment files in-memory, see

            In order to operate, your BDB XML application must be able to
            locate its container files, log files, and region files. If these
            are stored in the filesystem, then you must tell BDB XML where
            they are located (a number of mechanisms exist that allow you to
            identify the location of these files – see below). Otherwise, 
            by default they are located in the current working directory.
        </p>

                The environment home directory is used to determine where
                BDB XML files are located.  Its location
                is identified using one of the following mechanisms, in the
                following order of priority:

                        If no information is given as to where to put the
                        environment home, then the current working
                        directory is used.

                By default, all BDB XML files are created relative to the environment
                home directory. For example, suppose your environment home is in 
                    <code class="literal">/export/myAppHome</code>. Also suppose you name your container 
                    
                    <span><code class="literal">data/myContainer.dbxml</code>.</span>
                Then in this case, the container is placed in:
                    
                    <span><code class="literal">/export/myAppHome/data/myContainer.dbxml</code>.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            That said, BDB XML always defers to absolute pathnames.
            This means that if you provide an absolute filename when you 
            name your container, then that file is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            placed relative to the environment home directory. Instead, it
            is placed in the exact location that you specified for the
            filename.
         </p>
            <p>
            On UNIX systems, an absolute pathname is a name that begins with a
            forward slash ('/'). On Windows systems, an absolute pathname is a
            name that begins with one of the following:

                Try not to use absolute path names for your environment's
                files. Under certain recovery scenarios, absolute path
                names can render your environment unrecoverable. This
                occurs if you are attempting to recover your environment on
                a system that does not support the absolute path name that
                you used.

                As described in the previous sections, BDB XML will place all its
                files in or relative to the environment home directory.
                You can also cause a
                specific container file to be placed in a particular location by
                using an absolute path name for its name. In this
                situation, the environment's home directory is not
                considered when naming the file.

                It is frequently desirable to place container, log, and region files on separate
                disk drives. By spreading I/O across multiple drives, you
                can increase parallelism and improve throughput.
                Additionally, by placing log files and container files on
                separate drives, you improve your application's
                reliability by providing your application with a greater
                chance of surviving a disk failure.

                Defines the message handler that is called when an error message is

                this callback. It is up to the application to display this
                information correctly.
            </p>
                <p>
                Note that the message handler must be an implementation of the

            The subsystems that you enable for an environment (in our case,
            transaction, logging, locking, and the memory pool)
            are described by one or more regions.  The regions contain all of the
            state information that needs to be shared among threads and/or
            processes using the environment.
        </p>
          <p>
            Regions may be backed by the file system, by heap memory, or by
            system shared memory.

                When BDB XML dynamically obtains memory, it uses memory outside of the JVM. Normally the amount of memory
                that BDB XML obtains is trivial, a few bytes here and there, so you might not notice it. However, if 
                heap or system memory is used to back your region files, then this can represent a significant amount of
                memory being used by BDB XML above and beyond the memory required by the JVM process. As a result, the
                JVM process may appear to be using more memory than you told the process it could use.

           By default, shared memory regions are created as files in the environment's
           home directory (<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the environment's data
           directory). If it is available, the POSIX <code class="literal">mmap</code> 
           interface is used to map these files into your application's
           address space. If <code class="literal">mmap</code> 
           is not available, then the UNIX <code class="literal">shmget</code> interfaces 
           are used instead (again, if they are available).
        </p>
            <p>
            In this default case, the region files are named
            <code class="literal">__db.###</code>
            (for example, <code class="literal">__db.001</code>, <code class="literal">__db.002</code>,

            If heap memory is used to back your shared memory regions, 
            the environment may only be
            accessed by a single process, although that process may be
            multi-threaded. In this case, the regions are managed only in
            memory, and they are not written to the filesystem. You
            indicate that heap memory is to be used for the region files by
            specifying
                

                <span>

            When region files are backed by system memory, BDB XML creates a
            single  file in the environment's home directory. This file
            contains information necessary to identify the system shared
            memory in use by the environment. By creating this file, BDB XML
            enables multiple processes to share the environment.
        </p>
            <p>
            The system memory that is used is architecture-dependent. For
            example, on systems supporting X/Open-style shared memory
            interfaces, such as UNIX systems, the <code class="literal">shmget(2)</code>
            and related System V IPC interfaces are used. 
        
            
        </p>
            <p>
            On Windows platforms, the use of system memory for the region files
            is problematic because the operating system uses reference counting
            to clean up shared objects in the paging file automatically. In
            addition, the default access permissions for shared objects are
            different from files, which may cause problems when an environment
            is accessed by multiple processes running as different users. See
                <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">Windows notes</a>
            or more information.

          <p>
            When using environments, there are some security considerations to
            keep in mind:
        </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                    Database environment permissions
                </p>
                <p>
                    The directory used for the environment
                    should have its permissions set to ensure that files in the
                    environment are not accessible to users without appropriate
                    permissions. Applications that add to the user's permissions
                    (for example, UNIX <code class="literal">setuid</code> or
                    <code class="literal">setgid</code> applications), must be
                    carefully checked to not permit illegal use of those
                    permissions such as general file access in the environment
                    directory.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    Environment variables
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting 

                    
                    

                    so that environment variables can be used during file naming
                    can be dangerous. Setting those flags in BDB XML
                    applications with additional permissions (for example, UNIX
                    <code class="literal">setuid</code> or <code class="literal">setgid</code> 
                    applications) could potentially allow users
                    to read and write containers to which they would not normally
                    have access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, suppose you write a BDB XML application
                    that runs <code class="literal">setuid</code>. This means that
                    when the application runs, it does so under a
                    userid different than that of the application's caller.
                    This is especially problematic if the application is
                    granting stronger privileges to a user than the user
                    might ordinarily have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, if 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    then the environment that the application is
                    using is modifiable using the
                    <code class="literal">DB_HOME</code> environment variable. In
                    this scenario, if the uid used by the application has
                    sufficiently broad privileges, then the application's caller
                    can read and/or write containers owned by another user
                    simply by setting his
                    <code class="literal">DB_HOME</code> environment variable to the
                    environment used by that other user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this scenario need not be malicious; the
                    wrong environment could be used by the application
                    simply by inadvertently specifying the wrong path to 
                    <code class="literal">DB_HOME</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As always, you should use <code class="literal">setuid</code>
                    sparingly, if at all. But if you do use
                    <code class="literal">setuid</code>, then you should refrain from
                    specifying 
                    
                    
                    for the environment open. And, of course, if you must
                    use <code class="literal">setuid</code>, then make sure you use
                    the weakest uid possible – preferably one that is
                    used only by the application itself.

                <p>
                    By default, BDB XML always creates container and log files readable and
                    writable by the owner and the group (that is,
                    <code class="literal">S_IRUSR</code>,
                    <code class="literal">S_IWUSR</code>, <code class="literal">S_IRGRP</code> and
                    <code class="literal">S_IWGRP</code>; or octal mode 0660 on historic
                    UNIX systems). The group ownership of created files is based
                    on the system and directory defaults, and is not further
                    specified by BDB XML.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    Temporary backing files
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your BDB XML application is also using Berkeley DB
                    databases, then you should pay attention to temporary
                    backing files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an unnamed database is created and the cache is too small
                    to hold the database in memory, Berkeley DB will create a
                    temporary physical file to enable it to page the database to
                    disk as needed. In this case, environment variables such as
                    <code class="literal">TMPDIR</code> may be used to specify the
                    location of that temporary file. Although temporary backing
                    files are created readable and writable by the owner only
                    (<code class="literal">S_IRUSR</code> and <code class="literal">S_IWUSR</code>,
                    or octal mode 0600 on historic UNIX systems), some
                    filesystems may not sufficiently protect temporary files
                    created in random directories from improper access. To be
                    absolutely safe, applications storing sensitive data in
                    unnamed databases should use the 
                    
                    
                    <code class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.setTemporaryDirectory()</code>
                    method to specify a temporary directory with known permissions.
