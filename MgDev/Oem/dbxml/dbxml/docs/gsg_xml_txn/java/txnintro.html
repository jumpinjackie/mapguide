        Transactions offer your application's data protection from
        application or system failures.  That is, BDB XML transactions offer 
        your application full ACID support:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>A</strong></span>tomicity
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiple container operations are treated as a single unit of
                work.  Once committed, all write operations performed under 
                the protection of the transaction are saved to your containers.
                Further, in the event that you abort a transaction, all write
                operations performed during the transaction are discarded.
                In this event, your container is left in the state it was in
                before the transaction began, regardless of the number or
                type of write operations you may have performed during the
                course of the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that BDB XML transactions can span one or more
                container handles. <span>Also, transactions can
                span both containers and Berkeley DB databases, provided they
                exist within the same environment.</span>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>C</strong></span>onsistency
            </p>
            <p>
                Your containers will never see a partially completed
                transaction. This is true even if your application fails while there are
                in-progress transactions. If the application or system fails,
                then either all of the container changes appear when the
                application next runs, or none of them appear.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, whatever consistency requirements your application has will never be violated by BDB XML.
                If, for example, your application requires every record to include an employee ID, and your
                code faithfully adds that ID to its container records, then BDB XML will never
                violate that consistency requirement. The ID will remain in the container records until such a time as your
                application chooses to delete it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>I</strong></span>solation
            </p>
            <p>
                While a transaction is in progress, your containers will appear
                to the transaction as if there are no other operations 
                occurring outside of the transaction. That is, operations
                wrapped inside a transaction will always have a clean and
                consistent view of your databases. They never have to see
                updates currently in progress under the protection of another transaction. 
                Note, however, that isolation guarantees can be 
                
                 relaxed from the default setting.   See 
                <a class="xref" href="isolation.html" title="Isolation">Isolation</a>
                for more information.

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Once committed to your containers, your modifications will
                persist even in the event of an application or system failure.
                Note that like isolation, your durability guarantee can be
                relaxed. See <a class="xref" href="usingtxns.html#nodurabletxn" title="Non-Durable Transactions">Non-Durable Transactions</a>
                for more information.
