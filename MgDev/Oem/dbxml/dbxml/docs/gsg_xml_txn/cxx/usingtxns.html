      <p>
        Once you have enabled transactions for your environment and your containers,
        you can use them to protect your container operations. You do this by
        acquiring a transaction handle and then using that handle for any
        database operation that you want to participate in that transaction.
     </p>
      <p>
        You obtain a transaction handle using the
        
        
        
        <span><code class="methodname">XmlManager::createTransaction()</code> method.</span>
        
     </p>
      <p>
        Once you have completed all of the operations that you want to include
        in the transaction, you must commit the transaction using the 
        
        
        
        <span><code class="methodname">XmlTransaction::commit()</code> method.</span>
        
        
    </p>
      <p>
        If, for any reason, you want to abandon the transaction, you abort
        it using 
        
        
        
        <span><code class="methodname">XmlTransaction::abort()</code>.</span>
        

        <span>Note that if the last remaining
        <code class="classname">XmlTransaction</code> handle goes out of scope without
        being resolved, then the transaction is automatically aborted.
        </span>
    </p>
      <p>
        Any transaction handle that has been committed or aborted can no longer
        be used by your application.
    </p>
      <p>
        Finally, you must make sure that all transaction handles are either
        committed or aborted before closing your containers and environment.
    </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
            If you only want to transaction protect a single container write operation, you can use auto commit to 
            perform the transaction administration. When you use auto commit, you do not need an explicit transaction
            handle. See <a class="xref" href="autocommit.html" title="Auto Commit">Auto Commit</a> for more information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        For example, the following example opens a transactional-enabled environment and
        container, obtains a transaction handle, and then performs a write
        operation under its protection. In the event of any failure in the
        write operation, the transaction is aborted and the container is left in a
        state as if no operations had ever been attempted in the first place.

        <p>
            In order to fully understand what is happening when you commit
            a transaction, you must first understand a little about what
            BDB XML is doing with 
            
            <span>
            the logging subsystem. 
            </span>

            

            Logging causes all container  write operations to be identified in

            <span>logs, and by default these
            logs are backed by files on disk.  These logs are used to restore your containers 
            
            </span>

            
                    
            in the event of a system or application failure, so by performing
            logging, BDB XML ensures the integrity of your data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, BDB XML performs <span class="emphasis"><em>write-ahead</em></span>
            logging. This means that information is written to the logs
            <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the actual container 
            
            is changed.
            This means that all write activity performed under the
            protection of the transaction is noted in the log before
            the transaction is committed. Be aware, however, that container
            maintains logs in-memory. If you are backing your logs on
            disk, the log information will eventually be written to the log
            files, but while the transaction is on-going the log data may be
            held only in memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you commit a transaction, the following occurs:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    A commit record is written to the log. This
                    indicates that the modifications made by the
                    transaction are now permanent. By default, this write is performed synchronously to disk so the
                    commit record arrives in the log files before any other actions are taken.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Any log information held in memory is (by default)
                    synchronously written to disk. Note that this requirement can be
                    relaxed, depending on the type of commit you perform.
                    See <a class="xref" href="usingtxns.html#nodurabletxn" title="Non-Durable Transactions">Non-Durable Transactions</a> for
                    more information. 
                    <span>Also, if you are
                    maintaining your logs entirely in-memory, then this
                    step will of course not be taken. To configure your
                    logging system for in-memory usage, see
                    <a class="xref" href="logconfig.html#inmemorylogging" title="Configuring In-Memory Logging">Configuring In-Memory Logging</a>.
                    </span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    All locks held by the transaction are released. This means
                    that read operations performed by other transactions or
                    threads of control can now see the modifications without
                    resorting to uncommitted reads (see <a class="xref" href="isolation.html#dirtyreads" title="Reading Uncommitted Data">Reading Uncommitted Data</a> for more information).
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            To commit a transaction, you simply call
            
            
            
            <span><code class="methodname">XmlTransaction::commit()</code>.</span>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that committing a transaction does not necessarily cause data
            modified in your memory cache to be written to the files
            backing your containers on disk. Dirtied database pages are written
            for a number of reasons, but a transactional
            commit is not one of them. The following are the things that can cause a dirtied
            database page to be written to the backing database file:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    Checkpoints.
                </p>
              <p>
                    Checkpoints cause all dirtied pages currently existing
                    in the cache to be written to disk, and a checkpoint
                    record is then written to the logs.  You can run checkpoints
                    explicitly. For more information on checkpoints,
                    see <a class="xref" href="filemanagement.html#checkpoints" title="Checkpoints">Checkpoints</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Cache is full.
                </p>
              <p>
                    If the in-memory cache fills up, then dirtied pages
                    might be written to disk in order to free up space for other
                    pages that your application needs to use. Note that if
                    dirtied pages are written to the database files, then
                    any log records that describe how those pages were

            Be aware that because your transaction commit caused container
            
            modifications recorded in your logs to be forced to disk, your modifications
            are by default "persistent" in that they can be recovered in the event of
            an application or system failure. However, recovery time is
            gated by how much data has been modified since the last
            checkpoint, so for applications that perform a lot of writes,
            you may want to run a checkpoint with some frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
                Note that once you have committed a transaction, the transaction
                handle that you used for the transaction is no longer valid. To
                perform container activities under the control of a new
                transaction, you must obtain a fresh transaction handle.

                As previously noted, by default transaction commits are
                durable because they cause the modifications performed
                under the transaction to be synchronously recorded in 
                your on-disk log files.  However, it is possible to use 
                non-durable transactions.
            </p>
          <p>
                You may want non-durable transactions for performance
                reasons. For example, you might be using transactions
                simply for the isolation guarantee. 
                
                <span>
                In this case, you might
                not want a durability guarantee and so you may want to
                prevent the disk I/O that normally accompanies a
                transaction commit.
                </span>
                
            </p>
          <p>
                There are several ways to remove the durability guarantee
                for your transactions:

          <div class="itemizedlist">

                        Specify          
                            <span>
                                <code class="literal">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</code> using the

                            method. 
                            </span>
                            
                         This causes BDB XML to not synchronously force any
                            <span>
                                log

                         data to disk upon transaction commit. 
                         
                         <span>
                            That is, the modifications are held entirely
                            in the in-memory cache and the logging
                            information is not forced to the filesystem for
                            long-term storage.

                         Note, however, that the

                            </span>
                         data will eventually make it to the filesystem (assuming no
                         application or OS crashes) as a part of BDB XML's
                         management of its logging buffers and/or cache.

                            This form of a commit provides a weak durability
                            guarantee because data loss can occur due to
                            an application 
                            or OS crash.

                        This behavior is specified on a per-environment
                        handle basis.  In order for your application to exhibit consistent
                        behavior, you need to specify this 
                            <span>flag</span>
                            
                        for all of the environment handles used in your application.

                <p>
                        You can achieve this behavior on a transaction by transaction basis by
                            <span>
                                specifying <code class="literal">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</code> to the
                                    
                                    
                                    <code class="methodname">XmlTransaction::commit()</code>
                                method.
                            </span>

                            

                    </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                        Specify
                        <span>
                            <code class="literal">DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC</code> using the

                            method. 
                            </span>

                            

                            This causes 
                            <span>
                                logging 
                            </span>
                            data to be synchronously
                            written to the OS's file system buffers upon
                            transaction commit. The data will eventually be
                            written to disk, but this occurs when the
                            operating system chooses to schedule the
                            activity; the transaction commit can complete
                            successfully before this disk I/O is performed
                            by the OS.
                       </p>
                <p>
                                This  form of commit protects you against application
                                 crashes, but not against OS
                                crashes.  This method offers less room for the possibility of data loss than does
                                <span><code class="literal">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</code>.</span>

                        This behavior is specified on a per-environment
                        handle basis.  In order for your application to exhibit consistent
                        behavior, you need to specify this

                        for all of the environment handles used in your application.

              <li>
                <p>
                        Maintain your logs entirely in-memory. In this
                        case, your logs are never written to disk. The
                        result is that you lose all durability guarantees.
