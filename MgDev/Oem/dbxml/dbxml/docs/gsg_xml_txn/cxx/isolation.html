      <p>
            Isolation guarantees are an important aspect of transactional
            protection.  Transactions
            ensure the data your transaction is working with will not be changed by some other transaction.
            Moreover, the modifications made by a transaction will never be viewable outside of that transaction until
            the changes have been committed.
        </p>
      <p>
            That said, there are different degrees of isolation, and you can choose to relax your isolation
            guarantees to one degree or another depending on your application's requirements. The primary reason why
            you might want to do this is because of performance; the more isolation you ask your transactions to
            provide, the more locking that your application must do. With more locking comes a greater chance of
            blocking, which in turn causes your threads to pause while waiting for a lock. Therefore, by relaxing
            your isolation guarantees, you can <span class="emphasis"><em>potentially</em></span> improve your application's throughput.
            Whether you actually see any improvement depends, of course, on
            the nature of your application's data and transactions.

                BDB XML supports the following levels of isolation:

        <div class="informaltable">
          <table border="1" width="80%">
            <colgroup>
              <col />
              <col />
              <col />
            </colgroup>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Degree</th>
                <th>ANSI Term</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>READ UNCOMMITTED</td>
                <td>
                    Uncommitted reads means that one transaction will never
                    overwrite another transaction's dirty data.  Dirty data is
                    data that a transaction has modified but not yet committed
                    to the underlying data store. However, uncommitted reads allows a 
                    transaction to see data dirtied by another
                    transaction. In addition, a transaction may read data
                    dirtied by another transaction, but which subsequently
                    is aborted by that other transaction. In this latter
                    case, the reading transaction may be reading data that
                    never really existed in the container.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>READ COMMITTED</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                    Committed read isolation means that degree 1 is observed, except that dirty data is never read. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In addition, this isolation level guarantees that data will never change so long as
                    it is addressed by the cursor, but the data may change before the reading cursor is closed.
                    In the case of a transaction, data at the current
                    cursor position will not change, but once the cursor
                    moves, the previous referenced data can change. This
                    means that readers release read locks before the cursor
                    is closed, and therefore, before the transaction
                    completes. Note that this level of isolation causes the
                    cursor to operate in exactly the same way as it does in
                    the absence of a transaction.
                    </p>
                </td>

                    <p>
                    Committed read is observed, plus the data read by a transaction, T,  
                    will never be dirtied by another transaction before T completes.
                    This means that both read and write locks are not
                    released until the transaction completes.
                    </p>

                        no transactions will see phantoms.  Phantoms are records 
                        returned as a result of a search, but which were not seen by 
                        the same transaction when the identical
                        search criteria was previously used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is BDB XML's default isolation guarantee.

    By default, BDB XML transactions and transactional cursors offer 
    <span>
        serializable isolation. 
    </span>
    
    
    You can optionally reduce your isolation level by configuring BDB XML to use
    uncommitted read isolation. See 
        <a class="xref" href="isolation.html#dirtyreads" title="Reading Uncommitted Data">Reading Uncommitted Data</a> 
     for more information.

        You can also configure BDB XML to use committed read isolation. See
            <a class="xref" href="isolation.html#readcommitted" title="Committed Reads">Committed Reads</a>
        for more information.
        
  </p>
        <p>
          Finally, in addition to BDB XML's normal degrees of isolation, you
          can also use <span class="emphasis"><em>snapshot isolation</em></span>. This allows
          you to avoid the read locks that serializable isolation requires. See
          <a class="xref" href="isolation.html#snapshot_isolation" title="Using Snapshot Isolation">Using Snapshot Isolation</a>
          for details.

        <p>
                Berkeley DB allows you to configure your application to read data that has been modified but not yet
                committed by another transaction; that is, dirty data.  When you do this, you 
                may see a performance benefit by allowing your
                application to not have to block waiting for write locks. On the other hand, the data that your
                application is reading may change before the transaction has completed.
            </p>
        <p>
                That said, configuring BDB XML to read uncommitted data can
                result in internal inconsistencies which lead to random
                errors. For best results, you should avoid configuring your
                BDB XML transactions to read uncommitted data.

        <p>
                Committed Reads control the behavior of a Berkeley DB mechanism called a <span class="emphasis"><em>cursor</em></span>. Cursors
                are not something you would normally be using directly with your BDB XML application, unless you are
                using Berkeley DB databases alongside of your BDB XML containers. For that reason, this section is potentially
                not of great interest to you. Still, we present it here for the sake of completeness.
            </p>
        <p>
                For a thorough description of cursors, see the
                <em class="citetitle">Getting Started with Berkeley DB</em> guide.
            </p>
        <p>
                You can configure your transaction so that the data being
                read by a transactional cursor is consistent so long as it
                is being addressed by the cursor. However, once the cursor is done reading the 
                    
                    <span>
                        record (that is, reading records from the page that it currently has locked),
                    </span>
                    
                the cursor releases its lock on that
                    
                    <span>
                        record or page.
                    </span>
                    
                 This means that the data the cursor has read and released
                 may change before the cursor's transaction has completed.
              </p>
        <p>
                For example,
                suppose you have two transactions, <code class="literal">Ta</code> and <code class="literal">Tb</code>. Suppose further that
                <code class="literal">Ta</code> has a cursor that reads <code class="literal">record R</code>, but does not modify it. Normally,
                <code class="literal">Tb</code> would then be unable to write <code class="literal">record R</code> because
                <code class="literal">Ta</code> would be holding a read lock on it. But when you configure your transaction for
                committed reads, <code class="literal">Tb</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> modify <code class="literal">record
                R</code> before <code class="literal">Ta</code> completes, so long as the reading cursor is no longer
                addressing the 
                    
                    <span>
                        record or page.
                    </span>
                    
             </p>
        <p>
                When you configure your application for this level of isolation, you may see better performance
                throughput because there are fewer read locks being held by your transactions. 
                Read committed isolation is most useful when you have a cursor that is reading and/or writing records in
                a single direction, and that does not ever have to go back to re-read those same records. In this case,
                you can allow BDB XML to release read locks as it goes, rather than hold them for the life of the
                transaction.
             </p>
        <p>
                To configure your application to use committed reads, do one of the following:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Create your transaction such that it allows committed reads. You do this by
                            <span>
                                specifying <code class="literal">DB_READ_COMMITTED</code> when you open the transaction.
                            </span>
                            
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                            <span>
                                Specify <code class="literal">DB_READ_COMMITTED</code>
                                when you open the cursor. 
                            </span>
                            
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>

        <p>
                    By default BDB XML uses serializable isolation. An
                    important side effect of this isolation level is that
                    read operations obtain read locks on database pages,
                    and then hold those locks until the read operation is
                    completed. 
                    
                    
            </p>
        <p>
                    You can avoid this by using snapshot isolation.
                    Snapshot isolation uses <span class="emphasis"><em>multiversion
                    concurrency control</em></span> to guarantee
                    repeatable reads. What this means is that every time a
                    writer would take a read lock on a page, instead a copy of
                    the page is made and the writer operates on that page
                    copy. This frees other writers from blocking due to a
                    read lock held on the page.
            </p>

          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                        Snapshot isolation is strongly recommended for read-only threads when writer
                        threads are also running, as this will eliminate read-write contention and
                        greatly improve transaction throughput for your writer threads. However, in
                        order for snapshot isolation to work for your reader-only threads, you must
                        of course use transactions for your BDB XML reads.

          <p>
                    Snapshot isolation does not come without a cost.
                    Because pages are being duplicated before being
                    operated upon, the cache will fill up faster. This
                    means that you might need a larger cache in order to
                    hold the entire working set in memory.
            </p>
          <p>
                    If the cache becomes full of page copies before old
                    copies can be discarded, additional I/O will occur as
                    pages are written to temporary "freezer" files on disk.
                    This can substantially reduce throughput, and should be
                    avoided if possible by configuring a large cache and
                    keeping snapshot isolation transactions short.
            </p>
          <p>
                    You can estimate how large your cache should be by
                    taking a checkpoint, followed by a call to the 
                    <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive()</code>
                    
                    
                    method. The amount of cache required is approximately
                    double the size of the remaining log files (that is,
                    the log files that cannot be archived).

          <p>
                    In addition to an increased cache size, you may also
                    need to increase the maximum number of transactions
                    that your application supports. (See 
                    <a class="xref" href="maxtxns.html" title="Configuring the Transaction Subsystem">Configuring the Transaction Subsystem</a>
                    for details on how to set this.) 
                    In the worst case scenario, you might need to configure your application for one
                    more transaction for every page in the cache. This is
                    because transactions are retained until the last page
                    they created is evicted from the cache.

                           The simplest way to take advantage of snapshot
                           isolation is for queries: keep update
                           transactions using full read/write locking and
                           use snapshot isolation on read-only transactions or
                           cursors. This should minimize blocking of
                           snapshot isolation transactions and will avoid
                           deadlock errors.
                   </p>
          <p>
                           If the application has update transactions which
                           read many items and only update a small set (for
                           example, scanning until a desired record is
                           found, then modifying it), throughput may be
                           improved by running some updates at snapshot
                           isolation as well.  But doing this means that
                           you must manage deadlock errors.
