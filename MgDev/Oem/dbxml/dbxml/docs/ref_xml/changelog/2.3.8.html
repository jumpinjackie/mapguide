<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in BDB XML 2.3.8</u></h3>

The major focus areas for release 2.3 include:
<ul>
<li>Conformance to Proposed Recommendation of XQuery 1.0 and
XPath 2.0.
<li>Improved application integration by way of adding additional
interfaces for input and output of XML content, allowing
application-driven parsing and both push and pull content access 
without serialization of XML.
<li>Performance and scalability improvements.
<li>General bug fixes and improvements.
</ul>

<h3>Upgrade Requirements:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Changed database format to provide better node storage performance
and scalability.  Users must read documentation on container upgrade before
performing an upgrade, or there is risk of data loss.
</ol>

<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Conformance to Proposed Recommendations of XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0.</li>
<li>Use of the XQilla library replaces the use of XQuery and Pathan libraries.</li>
<li>Additional classes and related interfaces to allow direct pull and push
access to XML content :
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../api_cxx/XmlEventReader_list.html">XmlEventReader</a> -- 
    a class implementing a pull interface that enables input and output of 
    XML content via pull events, rather than serialized XML.</li>
  <li><a href="../../api_cxx/XmlEventWriter_list.html">XmlEventWriter</a> -- 
    a class implementing a push interface that enables input and output of 
    XML content via push events, rather than serialized XML.</li>
  <li><a href="../../api_cxx/XmlEventReaderToWriter_list.html">XmlEventReaderToWriter</a> -- 
    a class that associates an XmlEventReader with an XmlEventWriter, pushing
    events read from the XmlEventReader to the XmlEventWriter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>API Changes:</h3>
Unless otherwise noted, the API additions apply to all language bindings,
and all bindings use the same method name.
<ol>
<li>
Added new interface classes to enable input and output of XML content
via push and pull event interfaces, XmlEventReader, XmlEventWriter,
and XmlEventReaderToWriter [#11037].
</li>
<li>
XmlManager:
<ul>
<li>getFlags() -- return the flags field used to create the manager [#14403].</li>
<li>truncateContainer() and compactContainer() [#14163].</li>
<li>
XmlManager::get/setImplicitTimezone() -- set/get the implicit
timezone for queries where it is not explicit.  It is necessary to set this before
doing anything with indices related to data or time types.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlContainer:
<ul>
<li>
XmlValue getNode() -- enables loading of a previously-dumped
opaque (string) handle pointing directly to a node within
a document in the container, dumped by XmlValue::getNodeHandle().
</li>
<li>
getFlags()  -- return the flags field used to create/open the container [#14403].
</li>
<li>
Added XmlContainer::putDocument() method that takes
an XmlEventReader object as content.
</li>
<li>
Added XmlContainer::putDocumentAsEventWriter() method that 
allows the application to write content via an XmlEventWriter.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlResults:
<ul>
<li>
getEvaluationType() -- returns whether the XmlResults
object is XmlQueryContext::Eager or XmlQueryContext::Lazy.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlModify:
<ul>
<li>
Changed XmlModify to allow a variant that does not require an
initial context of XmlValue or XmlResult.  If there is only a single step, and
the XmlValue object passed to XmlModify::execute() is empty (not
initialized to any value), the query in that step will serve as the context for
the modification [#14774].
</li>
<li>
Added variants of the XmlModify steps that allow specification of
content as XmlResults object.  This change also enables new
content to comprise a sequence of elements, rather than be a single
element [#14533].
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlQueryContext::
<ul>
<li>
Added XmlQueryContext::interruptQuery() to allow application 
interruption of in-process queries.
</li>
<li>
Added XmlQueryContext::set/getQueryTimeoutSeconds() to set timeouts on
queries.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlDocument:
<ul>
<li>
setContentAsEventReader(XmlEventReader &reader) -- provide XML content as XmlEventReader.
</li>
<li>
getContentAsEventReader() -- return XML content as XmlEventReader.
</li>
<li>
getContentAsEventWriter(XmlEventWriter &writer) --
causes the system to write the content as events to
the provided XmlEventWriter object.
</li>
<li>
Added XmlDocument::equals method to non-C++ APIs [#15212].
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
XmlException:
<ul>
<li>
Added XmlException::getQueryFile, XmlException::getQueryLine() and
XmlExceptions::getQueryColumn() to provide location information 
for XQuery errors, improving error reporting and making debugging queries 
easier.  The reporting of this information is language binding-dependent,
and may vary among the support APIs [#13465].
</li>
<li>
Added XmlException::ExceptionCode values:
<ul>
<li>XmlException::EVENT_ERROR -- error in XmlEvent* classes.</li>
<li>XmlException::OPERATION_TIMEOUT -- query operation timed out.</li>
<li>XmlException::OPERATION_INTERRUPTED -- query operation was interrupted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
XmlValue:
<ul>
<li>
XmlValue::getTypeURI() and XmlValue::getTypeName() to return the specific 
type of the XmlValue returned [#14291].
</li>
<li>
XmlEventReader &asEventReader() -- returns node content as XmlEventReader.
</li>
<li>
std::string getNodeHandle() -- returns a string handle that represents
a direct pointer to the node, and can be resolved later using
XmlContainer::getNode().
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
virtual XmlInputStream *XmlResolver::resolveModuleLocation() method -- allows resolution of
as XQuery module namespace to a list of locations when there is no location URI.
</li>
<li>
virtual XmlInputStream *XmlResolver::resolveModule() method -- allows resolution of
XQuery modules referenced in a query.
</li>
<li>
Added DBXML_WELL_FORMED_ONLY flag to use to force the
use of the well-formed scanner for documents.  This scanner will make no
attempt to retrieve schema or DTDs, even if referenced.  The Java
equivalent for this is XmlDocumentConfig.setWellFormedOnly() [#14055].
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Changes That May Require Application Modification:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Changed database format to provide better node storage performance
and scalability [#13771].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in the choice of index used for comparisons. Users with decimal indices may find that they need to change them to double indices before they will work correctly [#15093].
</li>
<li>
Changed the default base URI to be "dbxml:/" (from "dbxml:"), so that is
compliant with RFC 2396 (URI specification). Containers that have been
opened using an absolute unix path may now have to use aliases to
reference them.  See the URI rule changes below [#13881].
</li>
<li>
Changed how BDB XML URIs are resolved against a base URI to be conformant
with the URI specification.  This affects naming of containers in
the arguments to fn:collection() and fn:doc().  Here are the current
rules.  Notes: by default, there is a base URI of "dbxml:/",
and "container_alias" is either a relative path to a container, or
an alias for that container, set using XmlContainer::addAlias().
<pre>
New style dbxml URIs
 dbxml:/container_alias/document
 dbxml://xxx/container_alias/document (NB xxx is the URL authority, and is ignored)
 dbxml:///container_alias/document
 dbxml:////absolute/path/to/container/document
 dbxml:/C:/windows/container/document
With base URI
 dbxml:/ + container_alias/document = dbxml:/container_alias/document
 dbxml:/container_alias + container_alias2/document2 = dbxml:/container_alias2/document2
 dbxml:/container_alias/document + /container_alias2/document2 = dbxml:/container_alias2/document2
 dbxml:///container_alias/document + /container_alias2/document2 = dbxml:///container_alias2/document2
 dbxml://xxx/container_alias/document + /container_alias2/document2 = dbxml://xxx/container_alias2/document2
 dbxml:/container_alias/document + document2 = dbxml:/container_alias/document2
Backwards compatibility mappings
 dbxml:container_alias/document -&gt; dbxml:/container_alias/document
</pre>
[#14234].
</li>
<li>
Replaced the Pathan and XQuery libraries with a single library
called XQilla, which implements both XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0.
This simplifies the build and removes redundant code [#13880].
</li>
</ol>

<h3>General Functionality Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Added several new XQuery extension functions that expose access to
BDB XML functionality, as well as documentation for BDB XML
XQuery extensions.  New extensions are:
<ul>
<li>dbxml:lookup-index()</li>
<li>dbxml:lookup-attribute-index()</li>
<li>dbxml:lookup-metadata-index()</li>
<li>dbxml:handle-to-node()</li>
<li>dbxml:node-to-handle()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where the default namespace for an element in no
namespace was not redeclared, even though the element was in the middle of
a document that already had a default namespace declared. [#13872]</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where a variable without a
prefix was using the default namespace from the statically known
namespaces [#13868]</li>
<li>
Fixed bug where an attempt to open a transactional container that
fails due to a version mismatch would result in errors from 
Berkeley DB regarding
"Locker not found" and eventually an environment PANIC, requiring recovery.
The same issue could arise if the open were to fail for other reasons as well [#13962].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where using XmlContainer::updateDocument() on a document
returned from a query that used lazy evaluation could result in an 
assertion failure [#13933].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where index entries were incorrectly deleted when 
updating a document either via XmlModify or updateDocument.  
The problem only occurred for containers without  
node indices and when there were multiple, identical index entries being
added/deleted during the update [#14173].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem where the Java XmlInputStreamWrap class, which implements
java.io.InputStream did not honor the InputStream contract to return -1 at EOF.
Instead it returned 0 [#14216].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a number of places where database errors, such as DB_ERR_DEADLOCK,
were getting lost and not properly passed to the caller [#14311][#14212]
[#14743][#15087].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug where errors from dbxml_dump were masked, silently resulting
in partial dump files if the container had any corruption [#14388].
</li>
<li>
Changed dbxml_load so that it will not attempt to load into an existing 
container, as doing so may corrupt the container [#14381].
</li>
<li>
Fixed various problems in example code [#14392].
</li>
<li>
Fixed double-delete crash that could occur when using XmlModify
to remove and add attributes on the same node, when the node originally has
more than one attribute [#14503].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem where leading whitespace in content passed to 
XmlModify steps could result in exceptions or bad updates [#14629].
</li>
<li>
Fix a situation where memory could leak if an application
were to use another library that includes the Xerces-C library in conjunction
with BDB XML [#14451].
</li>
<li>
Fixed bug where node storage containers could mangle DOCYTPE
declarations using PUBLIC [#14725].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in date/time comparisons [#14949].
</li>
<li>
Changed index syntax names to match the documentation, as well as be
case-insensitive.  The old (incorrect) names (for example, year vs
gYear) still work [#14961].
</li>
<li>
Modified index storage to be more efficient for non-string types, and
fixed bugs in the ordering of index entries with certain types (for
example, boolean).  Also removed index types of QName and NOTATION,
because namespace bindings are not available during indexing, and
removed index type of anyURI, because all comparisons on anyURI values
are done after casting to the string type.  Upgrade will automatically
replace these types with an equivalent string index [#14371].
</li>
<li>
Changed document ids to be 64-bit (were 32) [#15069].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in fn:lowercase() and fn:uppercase() where they did not handle 
Unicode characters well [#14382].
</li>
<li>
Used support in Berkeley DB 4.5 to fully support CDS in BDB XML (deadlock-free,
single-writer, multiple-reader concurrency, not transactional). [#14568].
</li>
<li>
Fixed XmlResults::next/previous iteration to be consistent with
the semantics of the underlying object.  The previous() call would not move
the cursor if it was positioned on the last value in the result set [#15145].
</li>
<li>
Modified node allocation algorithm for node ids used in partial
modifications to better utilize the node id space [#15154].
<li>
Fixed a problem where non-content (empty) documents
could not be deleted [#15159].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem where node equality check (XmlValue::equals) would fail
incorrectly when comparing across XmlDocument objects.
Added XmlDocument::equals method to non-C++ APIs [#15212].
</li>
<li>
Fixed a problem where adding indices to an encrypted container would not
encrypt the new index databases [#15253].
</li>
<li>
Added code to attempt to identify mismatched versions of Berkeley DB and BDB XML,
especially in non-C++ APIs such as Java, Python, and PHP.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Utility Changes:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Modified dbxml shell to use NULL as the default path for the DbEnv so
that the DB_HOME environment variable will be used [#15139].
</li>
<li>
Added commands to dbxml shell:
<ul>
<li>setIgnore -- causes it to ignore errors
while not in interactive mode, allowing scripts to continue running.  It has no
effect on interactive sessions [#15150].</li>
<li>sync -- flushes the cache to the physical databases.</li>
<li>setQueryTimeout -- sets a query timeout in seconds for queries run in 
the shell.</li>
<li>echo -- allows echoing of a string to stdout.</li>
<li>improved handling of ^C, which will now interrupt an in-progress query</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Java-specific Functionality Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Fixed a Java-specific problem where using 
XmlDocument.setContentAsXmlInputStream()
could lead to a double-delete of the underlying native memory for the 
XmlInputStream during finalization [#15126].
</li>
<li>
Fixed Java GettingStarted examples to use XmlContainer.delete() rather
than XmlContainer.close(), and call delete() methods on all objects
that need it to release container resources [#14668].
</li>
<li>
XmlContainer.close() is now mapped to XmlContainer.delete(), so it is no longer
possible to aggressively close the underlying databases without releasing
container references by explicitly deleting BDB XML objects.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Python-specific Functionality Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Added an XmlException class and exception hierarchy.
It is described in the file, dbxml/src/python/README.exceptions [#13959].
</li>
<li>
Modified code generation to enable threads and correctly handle
acquisition and release of the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
If threads are not desired, it is possible to compile without them by
modifying the source of src/python/dbxml_python_wrap.cpp to disable 
SWIG_PYTHON_THREADS.  This can be done by defining SWIG_PYTHON_NO_THREADS
[#14077].
</li>
</ol>

<h3>PHP-specific Functionality Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Fixed PHP XmlManager-&gt;createContainer() and openContainer() methods to
use flags arguments passed in [#14617].
</li>
<li>
Brought PHP interface up to date with respect to the current API, adding
missing interfaces [#13889].
</li>
<li>
Added XmlException to PHP interface when compiled under PHP5, which
supports exceptions.  This allows PHP5 scripts to catch XmlException [#15245].
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tcl-specific Functionality Changes:</h3>
None.

<h3>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Bundled version 4.5.20 of Berkeley DB, which includes Multi-Version
Concurrency Control (MVCC), allowing snapshot semantics for read-write
concurrency.  This will be quite useful for concurrent BDB XML 
applications (read/write concurrency).
</li>
<li>
XQuery and Pathan libraries have been replaced with a single library,
XQilla.  This library is not currently available from any other location.
</li>
<li>Added dependencies to example Windows project files [#13863].  This
showed up as a problem in parallel builds using Visual Studio .NET 2005.</li>
<li>
Modified Unix configuration and build to allow the
BDB XML library (libdbxml*) to built in a directory other than
dbxml/build_unix. The buildall.sh script uses the default 
build locations [#14772].
</li>
<li>
Consolidated all projects into the single, BDBXML_all.{dsw,sln} files 
for Windows build, and included all Berkeley DB utilities [#14098].
</li>
</ol>
