BDB XML 2.5.16 is a bug-fix release that addresses a number of issues found since release of <a href="#hist2513">2.5.13</a>.  It is source and binary compatible with earlier 2.5.x releases.  This section describes changes in BDB XML relative
to release 2.5.13.


<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4>
None relative to 2.5.13.  See <a href="#hist2513">2.5.13</a>
for upgrade details and recommendations.

<h4>General Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Upgraded the packaged version of Berkeley DB to 4.8.26. Please see the Berkeley DB specific change log for relevant changes.</li>
  <li>Fixed container creation so that it honors page size in
  XmlContainerConfig [#17803]</li>

<h3 align="center">Berkeley DB XML 2.5.13 Change Log</h3>

<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4> Containers do not require upgrade;
however because 2.5 bundles Berkeley DB 4.8 environment directories
and log files will not be compatible with previous releases.  This means
checkpoint, backup and recovery procedures are necessary to start with a clean
environment especially for transactional environments.

<h4>New Features:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Automatic indexing of leaf elements and attributes.  When a
  container is set in the auto-indexing state it will automatically
  detect new leaf elements and attributes and add string and double
  indexes for them (node-*-equality-string and node-*-equality-double).
  This feature has been added to enhance out-of-the-box performance of
  queries and can be used to replace default indexes in most cases.  Default
  value indexes have a tendency to over-index mixed content.
  Newly-created containers will be in this state, which is controlled by
  new API outlined below; some applications may wish to disable automatic indexing
  immediately after creating a container.  Addition of new indexes can be a significant
  operation so this behavior is best for containers that store similar
  documents or it must be carefully controlled by the application.  When
  enabled, addition of any new content can trigger the equivalent of
  XmlContainer::setIndexSpecification(). [#15722]</li>
  <li>Data compression for whole document storage.  XML documents can
  now be compressed using a built-in implementation based on the zlib
  compression library or user defined compression created by
  implementing the class <code>XmlCompression</code>.  [#15471]</li>
  <li>Debugging API and command line debugger. The command line debugger
  can be started using the "debug" command in the DB XML shell.  The
  debugging API is used by deriving a class from XmlDebugListener and
  registering it with the XmlQueryContext::setDebugListener() method.
  Access to the stack trace and dynamic context in each stack frame is
  available through the XmlStackFrame class during
  debugging. [#15999]</li>
  <li>XQuery external functions.  The XmlExternalFunction class allows
  the implementation of external XQuery functions in C++, Java and
  Python. Users should derive a class from XmlExternalFunction,
  implementing the execute() method to perform the function's action.
  Arguments are provided to the execute() method via the XmlArguments
  class. [#15610]</li>
  <li>Enhanced results handling
  <ul>
    <li>Added XmlResults::asEventWriter() which can be called on an empty
    (newly-created) XmlResults object to construct a sequence of elements
    and/or atomic values that can be used in queries.  The constructed
    object must be assigned to a variable to be used. [#16355]</li>
    <li>Added XmlResults::copyResults() and XmlResults::concatResults()
    which can be used to create and use "transient" copies of XmlResults
    which can be used outside of the context of a transaction or
    container</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Better node storage efficiency.  The storage algorithm for node
storage containers has been modified to provide a better btree fill
factor, resulting in smaller container files</li>
</ol>

<h4>API Changes:</h4> Unless otherwise noted, the API additions apply
to all language bindings, and all bindings use the same method name.
<ol>
  <li>There are new classes for the external XQuery function
  implementation noted above under features.  These are
  XmlExternalFunction and XmlArguments and are available only in C++,
  Java and Python.</li>
  <li>New interfaces control automatic indexing behavior:
  <ul>
    <li><code>XmlIndexSpecification::setAutoIndexing(bool) and
      XmlContainer::setAutoIndexing()</code><br> Use
    these to control automatic indexing.  The method on 
    XmlIndexSpecification will only take effect
    once <code>XmlContainer::setIndexSpecification()</code> is called with
    the modified XmlIndexSpecification object.  The method on XmlContainer
    is a convenience method that uses its underlying XmlIndexSpecification</li>
    <li><code>bool XmlIndexSpecification::getAutoIndexing() and
      XmlContainer::getAutoIndexing()</code><br>
    Returns the current state of automatic indexing for the container.
    The method on XmlContainer is a convenience method that returns
    the state from the XmlIndexSpecification</li>
  </ul>
  The modified XmlIndexSpecficiation instance must be set on the
  container using XmlContainer::setIndexSpecification() in order for the
  state change to occur.  The state is persistent and is set to true for
  newly-created containers.
</li>
<li>Added XmlContainerConfig to the API.  XmlContainerConfig already
existed in the Java API but has been expanded and is now available in
all other language bindings.  XmlContainerConfig simplifies opening
and creating of containers and is intended to replace the flags
arguments to operations that create and open containers.  The flags
versions still exist for now but will eventually disappear.</li>
<li>Added XmlCompression as a class that can be used to create
user-defined compression algorithms for wholedoc containers.  This
class is available only in C++ and Java</li>
<li>Added constructor <code>XmlValue(typeURI, typeName, value)</code>
for creating atomic values with derived types.</li>
<li>Added new functions to XmlData and changed it so that it functions
as an actual buffer for binary data rather than a wrapper for an
existing buffer.</li>
<li>Added the functions <code>XmlValue.getResults()</code>
and <code>XmlDocument.getResults()</code> to the Java API to return
the XmlResults object (if any) associated with the current object
[#16352]</li>
<li>Removed all <code>finalize()</code> functions from the Java
API. They served no useful purpose and could only cause problems by
running at inconvenient times [#16352]</li>
<li>Added XmlResults::asEventWriter() -- see description above under
"Features" [#16355]</li>
<li>Configuring a database as an XA-compliant resource manager using
the flag DB_XA_CREATE is no longer supported because XA support has
been removed from Berkeley DB [#16912]</li>
<li> XmlModify has been removed, XQuery Update should be used instead
[#16915]</li>
<li>The Berkeley DB C++ objects in the C++ API have been replaced with
their C equivalents.  This simplifies infrastructure and improves
build/linking with the non-C++ interfaces.  It requires changes for
C++ applications where they may have used DbEnv or DbTxn [#16951]</li>
<li>Added the function <code>XmlIndexSpecification.getValueType(index)</code> 
that returns the <code>XmlValue::Type</code> described in the given index 
description. [#17362]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Changes That May Require Application Modification:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>C++ applications are required to change the use of the Berkeley DB
  C++ objects in the public interface to their C equivalents.  Such
  changes are mechanical, replacing DbEnv* with DB_ENV * and DbTxn *
  with DB_TXN * and only a few interfaces are affected.  For example,
  XmlManager::XmlManager(DbEnv *, u_int32_t) becomes
  XmlManager::XmlManager::(DB_ENV *, u_int32_t).  The DbEnv object has a
  method, DB_ENV *DbEnv::get_DB_ENV() that can be used.  Similarly,
  DbTxn has a method DB_TXN *DbTxn::get_DB_TXN() that can be used.</li>
  <li>Automatic indexing may require changes.  It is enabled on
  newly-created containers by default and if an application wishes to
  not have this feature enabled it will need to explicitly disable it,
  post-creation.  Most applications will eventually want to disable this
  state once they are confident that all useful indexes have been added.
  An application that wants very explicit control over its indexes
  should disable it.  If it is not desired at all then immediately after
  creating a container call execute this sequence of operations (some
  pieces are missing and this example does not use transactions but
  these are the calls):<br>
  <code>
  XmlIndexSpecification is = container.getIndexSpecification();<br>
  is.setAutoIndexing(false);<br> container.setIndexSpecification(is,
  updateContext);<br>
  </code>
  <li>If compression is compiled in, which is the default, wholedoc
  containers are by default compressed using zlib compression.  This can
  be disabled using interfaces on XmlContainerConfig when creating the
  container.  Existing containers are not affected</li>
  <li>While the addition of XmlContainerConfig to the non-Java APIs does
  not require change it is recommended that applications move to the
  methods that use XmlContainerConfig as eventually the old interfaces
  will be phased out</li>
  <li>The functions in the XmlData class that use the Dbt object have
  been removed, including one constructor, <code>set_data</code>
  and <code>getDbt</code></li>
  <li>Java objects that require clean up must be cleaned up manually by
  calling the <code>delete()</code> function.  Failure to clean up
  objects can result in memory leaks and the need to run database
  recovery.  This has always been the case but removal of finalizers has
  made it even more important for memory leak situations</li>
  <li>The functions <code>XmlContainer.addIndex</code> and 
  <code>XmlIndexSpecification.addIndex</code> will now throw an exception if
  passed the index types <code>XmlValue.DAY_TIME_DURATION</code>, 
  <code>XmlValue.YEAR_MONTH_DURATION</code>, or 
  <code>XmlValue.UNTYPED_ATOMIC</code>.  If indexing the types 
  <code>XmlValue.DAY_TIME_DURATION</code> or 
  <code>XmlValue.YEAR_MONTH_DURATION</code> use <code>XmlValue.DURATION</code>.
    If indexing the type <code>XmlValue.UNTYPED_ATOMIC</code> use 
  <code>XmlValue.STRING</code>.  [#17365]</li>
</ol>

<h4>General Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The release bundles Berkeley DB 4.7.25</li>
  <li>Added a "--disable-rpath" option to the configure script, to
  facilitate building embedding rpath information in libraries
  [#16607]</li>
  <li>Fixed an uninitialized variable in NsEventWriter that could affect
  use of XmlEventWriter [#16459]</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where putting a document from one container into
  another would result in an empty document in the second container
  [#16456]</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where a deadlock exception in XmlEventWriter would
  mistakenly be reported as EINVAL and lost [#16343]</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where inserting a new root element into a document
  would not properly index the new content [#16500] </li>
  <li>The behavior of XQuery Update (and XmlModify) was changed so that
  multiple document elements are no longer allowed.  XQuery Update can
  also no longer be used to remove the document element to create an
  empty document.  Such documents can still be created but only via
  XmlContainer::putDocument() and XmlContainer::updateDocument()
  [#16500] </li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where text (comment, PI, text) updates that affect
  elements that own multiple text nodes could trigger an assertion
  failure or bad memory reference [#16543]</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where the behavior of eager and lazy results
  iteration was not consistent [#16484]</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where constructed documents could not be created from
  an XmlInputStream. [#16593]</li>
  <li>XmlValues created from an empty document will no longer crash on
  calls to certain functions. [#16608]</li>
  <li>XmlInputStream will no longer lose its source if the XmlDocument
  it came from is deleted.
  Also, <code>XmlDocument.getContentAsXmlInputStream()</code> will now
  always consume the content of constructed documents. [#16617]</li>
  <li>Fixed a static initialization problem that appears on some Windows
  platforms related to NsNid and results in an exception during
  XmlManager construction. [#16565]</li>
  <li>Fixed an assertion triggered when using a predicate against a
  variable containing constructed nodes. [#16556]</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where variable references to deleted nodes could
  lead to problems or incorrect behavior [#16583]</li>
  <li>Fixed a segmentation fault that could occur if the last step of a
  path was a comparison or contains() function. [#16772]</li>
  <li>The flags DBXML_ENCRYPT and DBXML_CHKSUM will no longer result in
  an exception when used correctly. [#16677]</li>
  <li>Fixed an assertion failure that could happen when using numeric
  predicates. [#16775]</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem where a transactional XQuery Update expression
  using fn:put() would fail during the transaction commit, indicating
  that the transaction was already committed[#16808]</li>
  <li>Change the close() methods in XmlEventReader and XmlEventWriter to
  be pure virtual. Implementors of XmlEvent* must implement the close()
  method which may need to delete "this" in order to free the
  memory. [#16771]</li>
  <li>Fixed XmlContainer::putDocument() and updateDocument() on wholedoc
  containers to ensure that new namespace uri prefixes are added to the
  dictionary. This could result in an exception during queries of read-only content
  or stray updates during read operations [#17212]</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem in partial updates where a delete of a node when
  it has an ancestor with a presence index could result in removal of the
  ancestor's index, resulting in incorrect query results [#17199]</li>
  <li>Fixed some issues in partial updates that might result in problems
  with indexes or missing records in the case where mixed content was being
  indexed and a descendent node is deleted or modified [#17226]</li>
  <li>Improved performance of partial reindexing when inserting a new element
  into a node that already has a large number of child elements [#17393]</li>
  <li>The functions <code>XmlContainer.addIndex</code> and 
  <code>XmlIndexSpecification.addIndex</code> will now throw an exception if
  passed the index types <code>XmlValue.DAY_TIME_DURATION</code>, 
  <code>XmlValue.YEAR_MONTH_DURATION</code>, or 
  <code>XmlValue.UNTYPED_ATOMIC</code>. </li>
  <li>Fixed problems with partial updates and statistics that
    affected both partial update performance and query plans resulting
    in lowered performance after a number of updates[#17393]</li>
  <li>Fixed XmlManager::compactContainer() so that space made available
    is released to the file system on platforms that support this
    behavior [#17658]</li>
  <li>Fixed an optimizer issue where certain range queries might not use
    an index if appropriate [#17649]</li>
  <li>Fixed a partial update scenario where indexes could get corrupted
    resulting in DB_NOTFOUND errors during queries or index lookups.  This could
    only occur when inserting multiple elements into the same parent node and
    not all the time [#17649]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Utility Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>dbxml shell subcommands that reflected the XmlModify interface
  have been removed</li>
</ol>

<h4>Java-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Fixed a bug where accessing XmlValue objects created from XQuery
  constructed nodes would cause a crash. [#16403]</li>
  <li>Added the functions <code>XmlValue.getResults()</code>
  and <code>XmlDocument.getResults()</code> to the Java
  API. [#16352]</li>
  <li>Fix a bug where updating queries that use nodes as variables would
  cause the JVM to crash. [#16583]</li>
  <li>Fix a bug where setVariableValue in Java API use XmlResult::size()
  which lazily evaluated does not support.</li>
  <li>Eliminated the possibility of XmlResolver objects being garbage
  collected while the object is still needed.[#16595]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Python-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The latest Python code from the pybsddb project is bundled.</li>
  <li>Modified interfaces that can legitimately return a NULL value (in
  C++ or Java) to return None in Python. [#16678]</li>
  <li>Fixed exception class constructors for XmlDatabaseError and
  XmlException.  Arguments were out of order. [#16628]</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Python bindings for XmlEventWriter::writeText()
  [#16626]</li>
  <li>Fixed a typo that made XmlInvalidValue exception
  unavailable[#16711]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Perl-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The Perl Db module included with BDB XML still uses the Berkeley
  DB C++ API.  This is not a change but a non-change that is the
  only place remaining in the product bundle that still uses the
  Berkeley DB C++ API.  This does not affect other languages at
  all.</li>
  <li>Added --perl-installdir to the buildall.sh script to allow users
  to change the installation directory for perl packages</li>
</ol>

  threads and in a server in Java</li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The build system for the BDB XML library on *nix now uses automake
  for better maintainability and portability</li>
  <li>Fixed XmlEventReader documentation to properly indicate that empty elements
  will not result in an EndElement event [#17213]</li>
</ol>
