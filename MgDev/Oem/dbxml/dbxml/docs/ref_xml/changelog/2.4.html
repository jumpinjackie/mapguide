<li>Scalability improvements in terms of reducing memory footprint
required during query processing and results handling.
<li>Performance improvements by using more intelligent, cost-based
query processing.
<li>Performance improvements by using iterator-based processing
instead of tree-processing.

</ul>

<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in BDB XML 2.4.16</u></h3>

BDB XML 2.4.16 is a bug-fix release that addresses a number of
issues found since release of <a href="#hist2413">2.4.13</a>.  It is source and
binary compatible with earlier 2.4.x releases.
This section describes changes in BDB XML 2.4.16 relative
to release 2.4.13.

<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4>
None relative to 2.4.13.  See <a href="#hist2413">2.4.13</a>
for upgrade details and recommendations.

<h4>General Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed a problem in the BDB XML XQuery Extension function 
dbxml:node-to-handle() where it could return an exception/error 
when attempting to create a handle for an attribute node. [#16180]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in query optimization which resulted in exponential 
query preparation time increases as the number of negative predicates 
used was increased. [#16181]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where it was not possible to open a 
container using the DB_RDONLY flag. [#16186]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem related to [#16186] where it was not possible
to open a replicated container because they are implicitly 
marked read-only. [#16394]</li>
<li>Fixed the generation of an incorrect query plan for a numeric 
predicate in a where clause, and a memory corruption when JIT optimizing 
a DecisionPointQP nested inside another DecisionPointQP.[#16206]</li>
<li>Fixed a query problem where expressions starting with "/"
would succeed on XML without a document node (e.g. constructed XML)
when they should fail. [#16230]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where metadata indexes would not be used in query
optimization. [#16273] </li>
<li>Fixed a bug in node construction across module boundaries. 
[#16288] </li>
<li>Fixed a bug where queries that performed multiple concurrent
sequencial scans on a whole document container would return 
incorrect results. [#16438] </li>
<li>Fixed a bug in optimization of certain query predicates that 
resulted in an inappropriate re-ordering of the results. [#16287] </li>
<li>Added a parameter to the QueryPlan optimisation methods
that decreases the number of optimisations returned with the depth of 
the query plan. This limits the exponential growth of optimisation time 
as queries get bigger. [#16321]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in wholedoc containers iterating over the
same document multiple times. [#16328]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the BufferQP optimisation logic.[#16330]</li>
<li>Fixed user defined default element namespaces in 
XmlQueryContext. [#16336]</li>
<li>Fixed querying of a no-content document to not SEGV. [#16338]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where insertion of new content could
result in a document that appeared fine but would no longer query correctly
under all circumstances. [#16340]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where valid URIs passed to fn:put() 
would appear invalid. [#16254]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in optimization of certain predicates that 
resulted in an inappropriate document order re-ordering of the results.
[#16287]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in node construction accross module boundaries. [#16288]</li>
<li>Eliminated overly-aggressive flags checking in calls to 
XmlManager::reindexContainer().  This prevented certain types of reindexing,
specifically from Java where the C++ flags are not under direct user control.</li>
<li>Allow DBXML_WELL_FORMED_ONLY flag for all 
XmlContainer::putDocument() variants.</li>
<li>Fixed preprocessor macros involving _MSC_VER that
caused some platform/compiler combinations to fail to build. [#16354]</li>
<li>Fixed a SEGV that could result from an invalid XQuery Update expression [#16373]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug due to a typo in the optimisation code for UnionQP. [#16402]</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition when reading the DecisionPointQP linked list. [#16413]</li>
<li>Modifications to reduce memory consumption of prepared queries.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in node size calculations that resulted in incorrect statistics in
the structural statistics database, leading to gradual query performance
degradation if lots of documents were removed or updated in place. [#16405]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in which results obtained via XmlContainer::getAllDocuments()
or other index lookup operation, when used as context for an XmlModify 
or XQuery Update operation could cause a self-deadlock/hang.  This would only
occur when using transactions. [#16397]</li>
<li>Added DB_RMW flag to transacted document updates and deletes to reduce
potential for deadlock. [#16464]</li>
<li>Fixed and assertion failure (SEGV in release mode) related to
using the count() function in a predicate in the where clause [#16470]</li>
<li>Allow DBXML_WELL_FORMED_ONLY flag in XmlIndexLookup::execute() and 
XmlContainer::getAllDocuments() [#16518]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem related to partial reindexing during XQuery Update that
  could result in DB_BUFFER_SMALL errors among others [#16551]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Java-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed problem in the XmlQueryContext copy constructor
where the XmlManager object was not being copied [#16177]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where an XmlValue.getAttributes() call on
an XmlValue object that was not the result of a query (e.g. directly
from an XmlDocument) could result in an error [#16179]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where XmlManager.reindexContainer() might fail a
flags check when it should not [#16221]</li>
<li>[#16236].  Fixed a Java-specific problem where some context queries
against constructed XML could cause a SIGSEGV.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem that could cause a crash in the JVM if a null
XmlUpdateContext object were passed.[#16222]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where XmlDocument.setContent(String) could 
improperly store characters, resulting in an exception when attempting 
to insert the document into a container. [#16257]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with XmlDocument that could result in the metadata 
no longer being accessible after the document content was retrieved. [#16296]</li>
<li>Made the XmlDocument copy constructor public. [#16353]</li>
<li>Fixed unnecessary materialization/parsing of wholedoc documents during
XmlResults iteration [#16517]</li>
</ol>

<h4>PHP-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Added missing createLocalFileInputStream() to XmlManager
API. [#16351]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Perl-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed Perl tests to run correctly</li>
</ol>

<h4>Utility Changes:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Changed dbxml shell to not allow opening or creating of containers
in an explicit transaction.  In a transactional shell those operations will
implicitly open the container in a transaction.  The additional transaction
can only create problems. [#16408]</li>
</ol>

<h3 align="center">Berkeley DB XML 2.4.13 Change Log</h3>

<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4>

Upgrade is only required for containers created using release 2.2.13
or earlier. Containers creating using 2.3.X do not require upgrade.
However, most queries will benefit from reindexing 2.3.X-based containers
to add new structural statistics information used in query cost analysis
so it is highly recommended.  Reindexing is <b>required</b> in order
to enable the substring index to be used on 1- and 2-character strings (a
new feature in 2.4).
<p>Reindexing should generally be performed offline as it is an expensive
operation that reads all content and regenerates index databases.</p>
<p>If an upgrade is performed (e.g. from 2.2.13) it is recommended
that the resulting container be run through dbxml_dump/dbxml_load to
reduce its file size.</p>

<h4>New Features:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Conformance to Last-Call Working Draft of XQuery Update 1.0</li>
<li>Added the ability to use "document projection" when querying whole-document
containers.  This performance and memory optimization results in only 
materializing that portion of the document relevant to the query.</li>
<li>Partial document modifications will now only reindex those portions
of the document(s) affected by the modification itself.  This is a
significant performance enhancement for partial update of large documents.</li>
</ol>

<h4>API Changes:</h4>
Unless otherwise noted, the API additions apply to all language bindings,
and all bindings use the same method name.
<ol>
<li>Added the DBXML_DOCUMENT_PROJECTION flag to the various query interfaces
to enable use of this feature.  In Java, this behavior is controlled by 
XmlDocumentConfig.setDocumentProjection()</li>
<li>Added a new XQuery extension function, dbxml:contains(), that
allows case- and diacritic-insensitive string searches and can
be optimized by a substring index</li>
<li>Removed all C++ interfaces that used Xerces-C DOM, including:
<ul>
<li>XmlDocument::setContentAsDOM()</li>
<li>XmlDocument::getContentAsDOM()</li>
<li>XmlValue::asNode()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>XmlModify is now a deprecated (but still-supported) class.  XQuery Update
should be used instead.  One method
has been removed as it is no longer supported by the internal 
infrastructure: XmlModify::setNewEncoding()</li>
<li>Added a new constructor to XmlEventReaderToWriter that allows an
XmlEventWriter instance to be multiple-use.  This makes it possible to
write to it from multiple reader sources to concatenate content, for example.</li>
<li>Removed XmlUpdateContext::{get,set}ApplyChangesToContainers() methods.  This
behavior is no longer controllable.  Changes to documents that are in containers
will always be written.  If transient changes are required, content must be 
copied (XQuery Update has syntax to do this directly)</li>
<li>Removed unused variant of XmlValue::asString(std::string &amp;encoding).  This variant never actually changed the encoding [#15822]</li>
<li>Added DBXML_STATISTICS and DBXML_NO_STATISTICS flags to enable/disable
creation of an additional statistics database that is used for query
optimization.  The default is to create the database.  Upgraded
containers will NOT have a statistics database added unless they are
explicitly reindexed.  The cost of this optimization is a bit of extra
work during document insertion.  In Java this behavior is controlled by
XmlContainerConfig.setStatisticsEnabled()</li>
<li>
Added the DBXML_NO_AUTO_COMMIT flag, which can be specified to the XmlQueryExpression::execute()
methods to turn off auto-commit of update queries when it is not appropriate.
</li>
<li>
Some XmlException error codes have changed - DOM_PARSER_ERROR and NO_VARIABLE_BINDING have
been removed, XPATH_PARSER_ERROR is now called QUERY_PARSER_ERROR, and XPATH_EVALUATION_ERROR
is now called QUERY_EVALUATION_ERROR. [#15792]
</li>
<li>The enumeration,  XmlQueryContext::DeadValues, has been removed.
The related method, XmlQueryContext::setReturnType() remains but is
a no-op.  All results are LiveValues.  This will not affect the vast
majority of applications.</li>
<li>Added XmlQueryExpression::isUpdateExpression() to allow users to 
know whether an expression is updating or not</li>
</ol>

<h4>Changes That May Require Application Modification:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Some of the API changes above may result in the need to
make minor code changes</li>
<li>Not all modification patterns that use XmlModify will
continue to work given the new infrastructure.  Specifically,
operations that would both copy and delete the same content (emulating
a "move" operation) may not work.  In all cases, such code can
be rewritten to use XQuery Update directly, resulting in simpler
code.  Special attention should be paid to multi-step operations
that include such side effects.</li>
<li>Changed default indexing type on containers to be node indexes
for node storage containers and document indexes for document storage
containers [#15863].</li>
<li>Java only -- the function XmlContainer.getNode() 
function has changed its signature and will require code change if used.
See details below under "Java-specific Functionality Changes."</li>
</ol>

<h4>General Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Partial document modification will result in only reindexing those
portions of document(s) affected by the modification</li>
<li>The system now keeps better cost information and statistics
and the query optimizer uses this information to perform more effective
cost-based optimization</li>
<li>The content processing internals have been reworked to make 
heavy use of iterators and temporary Berkeley DB databases to 
significantly reduce the memory footprint of query handling as well
as reduce the number of objects created and destroyed by a query.
This leads to a more scalable, high-performance system</li>
<li>Substring indexes will now work on any length search string (e.g. 2-char)
rather than be restricted to a 3-character minimum.  Reindexing the container
is required to get this functionality.</li>
<li>Various fixes and memory leak elimination in XmlEventWriter[#15405]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where removing a default index could remove index
entries for an overlapping non-default index[#15412]</li>
<li>Changed semantics of XmlQueryContext::setNamespace() to treat an empty 
namespace prefix as the default element namespace[#15630]</li>
<li>Fixed problem in XmlModify that could result in malformed XML if
a prefixed element name were used without a mapping for that prefix[#15586]</li>
<li>Fixed URI resolution code to <em>not</em> add the base URI when the
URI being resolved is absolute[#15583]</li>
<li>Fixed code to force explicit transactions (vs auto-commit) when 
using XmlContainer::putDocumentAsEventWriter.  This is necessary because
of the 2-part nature of this interface [#15578]</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur if XmlResults.next() were called
at the end of a result set [#15621]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where XQuery expressions involving unused global 
variables were not being optimized correctly [#15661]</li>
<li>Fixed problem in XmlEventReader::nextTag() where it would
mistakenly throw an exception on character data.  Also changed 
semantics of XmlEventReader to always return start and end document
events so that callers can know when content starts and ends [#15686]</li>
<li>Fixed case where the '>' character was not being escaped
properly (according to the XML specificiation).  This case is when it
occurs in the sequence, "]]>" [#15739]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in XmlModify where removing a node that was the last
child and had leading text could cause a SEGV [#15615]</li>
<li>Enhanced XmlEventReaderToWriter API to not unconditionally close
the XmlEventWriter object, allowing a single XmlEventWriter to be used
more than once via that API.  This allows XmlEventReaderToWriter to be used
for example, to coalesce a number of results into one document [#15446]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with XmlIndexLookup where a GT lookup that happens 
to start with the last entry in the index might return results when 
it should return none[#15408]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which incorrectly reported an error for fractional seconds 
when the seconds filed was "59" [#15389]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in statistics calculation for substring indexes that
could cause a crash in fn:contains() [#15823]</li>
<li>Fixed a bad exception that might be thrown when inserting a
schema-invalid document, due to the length of the error message [#15824]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where a query that uses an XmlDocument that has just been
"put" into a continer as context for the query might hang if done in the
same transaction as the putDocument call[#15905]</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where querying empty CDATA sections could cause an 
assertion failure or bad memory refernce[#15906]</li>
<li>Fixed a latent bug that could result in missing index entries after
updateDocument or modifyDocument call.  This is very obscure and has never
been seen by a user.  It requires an odd combination of indexes and
updates[#15943]</li>
<li>Fix open/close race condition on XmlContainer.  An application that
concurrently opened/closed XmlContainer objects (not recommended...)
could possibly reference bad memory [#15890]</li>
<li>Fixed several memory leaks that could occur if deadlock exceptions
are thrown during document processing (most likely put and delete)</li>
<li>All update operations now work inside internal child transactions
to ensure that they are properly aborted if necessary.  This is not
user visible</li>
<li>Internal buffer size for DB get operations on nodes is
tuned to the calling operation (bulk vs single get)[#15607]</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in XmlEventWriter where the behavior was dependent on an uninitialized variable [#15968]</li>
<li>Changed dbxml_load_container to take a '-e' flag that causes the program to stop document loading in the event of a parse error.  The default is to continue with the next document [#15777].</li>
<li>Fixed problem in XmlModify where newly-inserted element content could
cause a bad memory reference and/or crash while calculating a new node id [#15974].</li>
</ol>

<h4>Utility Changes:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The dbxml shell added commands:
<ul>
<li>setProjection allows control of the document projection feature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The dbxml shell can be invoked using the #! syntax in a *nix
shell command, e.g. with the first ilne:<br>
#!<absolute_path>/dbxml -s
<br>
</li>
<li>Handling of '#' comment lines in the dbxml shell has been improved
so that they can occur anywhere in a line [#15689]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Java-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed a problem where committed or aborting a transaction that was
already committed or aborted could crash, especially after a failed
XmlManager.openContainer() call [#15729]</li>
<li>Is it no longer be necessary to explicitly delete objects of type XmlValue,
XmlDocument, XmlQueryContext, XmlMetaData, XmlMetaDataIterator and XmlUpdateContext.  
They are implemented entirely as pure Java
objects with no native memory to release.  It will still be necessary
to explicitly delete other Java objects to release native memory.
In general the validity of XmlValue and XmlDocument objects returned
via XmlResults (queries, index lookups, etc) is under control of the
XmlResults object.  When the XmlResults object is deleted node values
that may have been associated with that object may no longer be
accessible and an exception will be thrown if accessed [#15194]</li>
<li>Added -source 1.5 -target 1.5 to Java builds to be explicit, especially
for Windows binary build.  The current code *will* work with 1.4 or 1.6 if the arguments are 
changed (manually) [#15986]</li>
<li>The function XmlContainer.getNode() function has changed its signature.
Instead of XmlValue it now returns XmlResults.  The XmlValue that was 
previously returned can be retrieved using XmlResults.next().  There will
never be more than one value in this result.  It is necessary
to explicitly delete the returned XmlResults object (XmlResults.delete())
when the application no longer needs access to the returned value.  Once
deleted the information in the XmlValue may no longer be accessible.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Python-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed XmlEventReader in Python so that methods returning unsigned char *
would be mapped properly into Python strings [#15608]</li>
<li>Changed implementation of XmlException and related classes to make them
part of the dbxml (vs _dbxml) module [#15617]</li>
<li>Changed names of XmlException attributes to start with lower-case letters.
See src/python/README.exceptions.</li>
<li>Moved examples to dbxml/examples/python directory and added some additional
basic examples</li>
</ol>

<h4>PHP-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Fixed code that resulted in build and runtime errors on 64-bit
platforms.  One symptom was "std::bad_alloc" exceptions.  The issue
was a mix of 64- and 32-bit types resulting in attempts to allocate
huge amounts of memory [#15587]</li>
<li>Fixed compilation problems in a threaded (ZTS) environment related
to the use of incorrect macros in a few places [#15746]</li>
<li>Fixed problem (SEGV) constructing XmlIndexLookup objects as well as several
other problems with this class implementation [#16168]</li>
<li>Moved examples to dbxml/examples/php</li>
<li>Fixed XmlValue constructor to accept explicitly typed strings [#15996]</li>
</ol>

<h4>Perl-specific Functionality Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Moved examples to dbxml/examples/perl</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example Code Changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Added examples/cxx/xerces directory with example code that
provides the same functionality that the Xerces-C DOM interfaces
previously provided.  They are written as example code to
illustrate an integration with Xerces-C DOM and to also illustrate
use of the XmlEvent* classes for such an adapter</li>
<li>Moved examples for all languages to dbxml/examples/* to
consolidate them and make packaging simpler</li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>XQilla 2.0 is bundled.  XQilla 2.0 is released under a permissive
(Apache) license</li>
<li>Windows static build projects are included</li>
<li>Project and solution files for Visual Studio version 8.00 have been added
for use by Visual Studio 2005 and later releases.  The new solution file is BDBXML_all_vs8.sln.</li>
<li>Added Berkeley DB project files to the BDB XML build_windows directory for 
Visual Studio 7.1 and 8 builds.  This means that the included DB projects will be built
directly in the BDB XML tree and not in the Berkeley DB tree.  This does not apply to
the VC6 projects and workspace and does not affect where the default build installs
executables and libraries. VS7.1 project files for Berkeley DB examples are no longer  included.</li>
</ol>
