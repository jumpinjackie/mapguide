<h1 align="center">Berkeley DB XML 2.0.7 & 2.0.9 Change Log</h1>

<h3>Upgrade Requirements:</h3>		
<ol>

<li>The database format has changed due to the large number of new
features and new storage and indexing options in in 2.0.  These changes
are incompatible with DB XML 1.2.1 databases.  Consequently applications
will need to manually dump any existing DB XML 1.2.1 databases and load
them into a new DB XML 2.0 database or reload them from the source XML
documents.

</ol>		
<h3>New Features:</h3>		
<ol>

<li>Support for XPath 2.0, including new data types.
<li>Support for XQuery 1.0.
<li>Support for additional index types.
<li>Improved large document support. 
<li>Significant API improvement and extension to support new functions.
Introduction of factory methods to create objects.
<li>Support for fine grained document storage. 
<li>Naming and cross-container operation support. 
<li>Enhanced Metadata support. 
<li>Support for document loading. Documents can now be loaded from input
streams (including local files and URLs) or raw memory locations.
<li>Enhanced document update functionality.
<li>Support for DOM-like navigation methods on XmlValue.
<li>New classes for XmlInputStream, XmlData, XmlManager, XmlStatistics,
XmlMetaDataIterator and XmlTransaction.

</ol>		
<h3>General Functionality Changes:</h3>		
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where XmlContainer::getDocument() was not passing in user
supplied flags. [#9607]
<li>Fix a bug where a Container::Close() did not reset ID members, so a
re-create failed to write them to a new container. Fix a bug where
open() and versionCheck() would attempt to write even when the flags
specified DB_READONLY. [#9608]
<li>Fix a bug where duplicate index keys were not sorted, causing poor
performance for deleteDocument(). [#9737]
<li>Fix a bug where adding an index to a container which contains
documents in a CDS configured environment would cause the thread to
self-deadlock.  [#9925]
<li>Fix a bug where documents weren't being returned for queries on the
presence of metadata when the metadata was indexed. [#10487]
<li>Fix a double-free bug in Node Storage for certain size/shaped
documents. [#11641]

</ol>		
<h3>API Changes:</h3>		
<ol>

<li>New classes for XmlInputStream, XmlData, XmlManager, XmlStatistics,
XmlMetaDataIterator and XmlTransaction.

<li>Add XmlManagerConfig, XmlContainerConfig and XmlDocumentConfig
