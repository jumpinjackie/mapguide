<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in BDB XML 2.2.13</u></h3>

<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4>

None, relative to BDB XML 2.2.8, but because of the issue in [#13820]
(see below) it is recommended that any containers that were:

<ol>
<li>used with BDB XML 2.2.8, and
<li>are using node indices (DBXML_INDEX_NODES), and
<li>have been modified using either XmlModify or
XmlContainer::updateDocument()
</ol>
be reindexed.  This can be achieved using either dbxml_dump followed by
dbxml_load, or the in-place dbxml shell command, "reindexContainer."

<h4>New Features</h4>

None.

<h4>General API Changes</h4>

None.

<h4>Java-specific API changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Added XmlDocument.getContentAsInputStream() to Java API to enable
use of a java.io.InputStream object for document output [#13701]
<li>Eliminated default constructors for Java objects [#13640]

</ol>
<h4>General Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Fixed a bug where variables declared at global scope in an XQuery
expression would fail with a null pointer reference [#13588]
<li>Fixed bug in node storage containers where concurrent applications
could receive a deadlock exception that was ignored, resulting in an
assertion failure or bad pointer reference [#13597]
<li>Support for CDS now requires setting of the DB_CDB_ALLDB flag if the
DB_INIT_CDB flag is set in a DB environment.  This is because BDB XML
modifications affect more than one DB database.  This may affect
existing applications, which will need to change to set the DB_CDB_ALLDB
flag [#13568]
<li>Fixed a bug where a query using descendant-or-self() would return
all named elements that follow the target node in document order, rather
than just returning descendants [#13618]
<li>Changed XmlException to DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND when calling
XmlContainer::updateDocument() for a document that does not exist.
Previously, it would throw with the code, DATABASE_ERROR and errno,
DB_NOTFOUND [#13691]
<li>Fixed some problems when DbTxn and XmlTransaction were used together
[#13679]
<li>Fixed a bug where, if Xerces is initialized separately from BDB
XML, and it outlives the last XmlManager, it is possible for it to
contain a reference to deallocated memory [#13722]
<li>Fixed a bug where adding and then deleting an index on an empty
container caused an exception [#13724]
<li>Fixed problem where an open of an existing container with a
non-default page size using DB_CREATE would throw an exception from
Berkeley DB  with the message "Different pagesize specified on existent
file" and errno EINVAL [#13768]
<li>Fixed a bug where a crash could occur in the function,
NsWriter::~NsWriter().  The problem was calling pop_back() on an empty
STL vector [#13826]
<li>Fixed a bug where the first result could be left out of query
results.  Certain ueries using the descendant axis are most vulnerable
[#13816]
<li>Fixed a bug where index entries could be mistakenly removed
following a document update (via XmlModify or
XmlContainer::updateDocument) [#13820]
<li>Fixed XmlManager::reindexContainer(), which was introduced in BDB
XML 2.2.8 to work correctly.  Previously, the index type would change,
but the entries created would not [#13850]
<li>Fixed a bug where some node indices on attributes failed to be
optimized, resulting in slower than expected queries.  This only affects
containers with node indices enabled [#13642]
<li>Fixed a bug that occurred when a user-defined function was called
from more than one place in the query, and the function used either
fn:collection() or fn:doc(). This happened because a query plan was
generated for the user-defined function body more than once - with the
last generation replacing the former. The two query plans are now
combined to make the correct query plan. [#13639]

</ol>
<h4>PHP-Specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Added a global declaration of the XmlIndexLookup class that was
missing from php_dbxml.cpp.  This resulted in undefined references to
this class that look like: <pre>undefined symbol:
php_dbxml_XmlIndexLookup_ce</pre>

</ol>
<h4>Utility Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Added a "time" sub-command to the dbxml shell utility [#13571]

</ol>
<h4>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Added support for building with Microsoft's Visual Studio 2005
[#13491]
<li>Changed Windows debug information to "Program Database"
consistently.  This means the /Zi flag is used rather than /Z7 [#13737]
<li>Changed debug .pdb filename for Pathan from PathanD.pdb to
PathanD_7.1.pdb [#13737]
<li>Fixed incorrect documentation regarding use of DB_DEGREE_2 in
container create/open flags.  The correct flag to be documented is
DB_DIRTY_READ, which will be DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED in future releases that
bundle DB 4.4 or higher [#13592]
<li>Example code in the Getting Started Guide documentation was reviewed
and updated to be correct [#13602]
<li>The Getting Started Guide documentation was corrected where it
erroneously stated that the XQuery expression "/Node1/Node2/Node3" would
only return the first Node3 element, when it would really return all
matching elements [#13604]

</ol>

<h4>Upgrade Requirements</h4>
<ol>

<li>Changed database format from BDB XML 2.1.8 to provide better
Berkeley DB Btree page fill factor.  Users must read documentation on
container upgrade before performing an upgrade, or there is risk of data
loss [#12947]

</ol>
<h4>New Features</h4>
<ol>

<li>Add XmlManager::existsContainer(), used to check for existence of a
container in an efficient, non-destructive, non-intrusive manner
[#11018]
<li>Implement support for "fn:doc-available()" Xquery function and
default collections [#12762]
<li>Add XmlIndexLookup class to perform lookup operations, including
equality, range lookups, and controlling the sort order of results
(forward and reverse) [#12556]
<li>Version 2.7 of the Xerces library is now used [#13177]
<li>XQuery implementation has been upgraded to support the April, 2005
draft specification

</ol>
<h4>General API Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Add XmlIndexLookup class to perform lookup operations, including
equality, range lookups, and controlling the sort order of results
(forward and reverse) [#12556]
<li>Fix a bug where XmlResults::hasNext() and XmlResults::peek()could
result in uncatchable exceptions with Lazy results [#13053]
<li>Added XmlQueryContext get/setVariableValue variant that takes
XmlResults to allow sequence variables [#13060]
<li>Add XmlManager::reindexContainer() to allow an application to change
the index type between node-level and document-level [#12819]
<li>Add XmlManager::get/setDefaultSequenceIncrement() interfaces to
allow control over the cache size of the DbSequence object used to
allocate document ids [#13099]
<li>Add XmlValue::BINARY as a valid XmlValue type.  Add
XmlValue::isBinary() interfaces to support the new type [#13221]
<li>Add support for the DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE flag when creating and
opening an XmlContainer [#13263]
<li>AddXmlManager::openContainer() method that takes XmlContainerType
and mode arguments [#13285]
<li>AddXmlContainer::getIndexNodes() to indicate if the container has
node-level indices or not

</ol>
<h4>General Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Modify internal data structures so that fewer lockers are required
when running without transactions.  This eliminates many problems that
appear to be locker "leaks."[#12104]
<li>Implement April 2005 drafts of XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0
<li>Implement numerous query optimizations that should increase the
query speed on all storage formats. This includes support for node-level
indices specified using DBXML_INDEX_NODES [#12615]
<li>Fix a bug so that unique indices will find constraint violations
within a single document and between documents in a container[#12838]
<li>Fix a bug where index database creation could conflict with other
updates [#12839]
<li>Fix a bug in QueryPlanHolder that could cause a segment fault
[#13069]
<li>Fix a bug during container open where the containers page size is
different from the XmlManagers default page size [#13260]

</ol>
<h4>Java-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Change path to example package from
com.sleepycat.dbxml.examples.gettingStarted to dbxml.gettingStarted
[#12108]
<li>Fix a bug so that valid DatabaseException objects are now created
for all XmlExceptions of type DATABASE_ERROR [#12962]
<li>Fix a bug so that XmlDocument.getMetaData() will correctly return
binary metadata [#13193]
<li>Fix a bug in XmlInputStream so that other classes can now be derived
from this class [#13289]

</ol>
<h4>Perl-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Compiler information from configure is now used to set the compiler
in the Perl build [#12491]

</ol>
<h4>Python-specific Functionality Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Add pre-compiled Python binaries (2.4) to the Windows binary
installer
<li>Ship copy of the pybsddb project for convenience and ease of build

</ol>
<h4>Utility Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug in dbxml shell so that if h flag is not specified an
attempt is made to join an environment in the current directory[#12993]
<li>Add support for new XmlIndexLookup object in the dbxml shell's
commands [#12556]

</ol>
<h4>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes</h4>
<ol>

<li>Add a version check to insure that languages such as Perl, Python,
and PHP use a compatible version of Berkeley DB [#12681]
<li>Change default in buildall.sh script to build thread support for
Xerces platform code [#12784]
<li>Add documentation for the c flag in dbxml shell [#12848]
