            Welcome to Berkeley DB XML (BDB XML), an embeddable XML
            database engine that provides support for XQuery access.  This
            document will introduce you to BDB XML's feature set.  After
            reading this document you should have a good understanding of
            what BDB XML can do for you and how it might be used to manage
            XML data within your systems and applications.  Follow along
            with the examples and try out BDB XML on your system.
        </p>
      <p>
             BDB XML is an embedded database specifically designed for the
             storage and retrieval of XML-formatted documents.  Built on
             the award-winning Berkeley DB, BDB XML provides for efficient
             queries against millions of XML documents using XQuery.
             XQuery is a query language designed for the examination and
             retrieval of portions of XML documents.
        </p>

                Typically, BDB XML is used as a library that is linked directly 
                into your application. In addition, BDB XML has a command line 
                shell that allows you to work with XML documents outside of the 
                programming languages that you normally use to interact with BDB XML. 
                You can use the command line shell as part of your application, as a 
                management tool, or simply as a means to explore the features of the 
                product as we do here.

        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                    Remember that BDB XML is an
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>embedded</em></span> database engine that
                    supports XML data and queries against that data.
                    This means that in contrast to other database systems,
                    Berkeley DB (and BDB XML) is not a relational database,
                    is not a database server, and it does not support SQL
                    queries. Instead, it is a libarary that is meant to be
                    used directly with your code and which provides XQuery
                    queries against the XML data that you store within the
                    engine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
                 In BDB XML, all XML data is stored within files called containers. 
                 The BDB XML shell provides a simple and convenient way to work with 
                 these containers and exposes most of the BDB XML functionality in a 
                 friendly, interactive environment, without requiring the use of a 
                 programming language. 
            </p>
        <p>
                Containers are really a collection of XML documents and
                information about those documents. For example, containers
                include any indexes that are being maintained for the
                documents. 
             </p>
        <p>
                Containers also store XML documents as either whole
                documents or as nodes. When containers store whole
                documents, the XML document is stored all as one unit in
                the container exactly as it was presented to the system.
                When documents are stored as nodes, the XML document is
                deconstructed into smaller pieces – nodes – and
                those small chunks are what is stored in the container.
             </p>
        <p>
                For the node storage case, retrieval of the document still
                returns the document in <span class="emphasis"><em>mostly</em></span> the
                same formatting state (assuming you didn't modify it) as it
                was in when it was stored in the container. The only
                difference is how the document is physically held within
                the container. Note that node storage typically offers
                better performance than does whole document storage, and
                for this reason node storage is the default container type. 
            </p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                    In some cases, node storage may change your document
                    slightly. For example, an empty node in your document 
                    like this: 
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">&lt;node1&gt;&lt;/node1&gt;</pre>
          <p>
                    Will be stored in the container and returned as this:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">&lt;node1/&gt;</pre>
