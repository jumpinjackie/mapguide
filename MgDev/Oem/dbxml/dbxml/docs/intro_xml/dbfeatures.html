            Berkeley DB XML inherits a great many features from Berkeley DB. 
            These features put it years ahead of the competition and makes it 
            an ideal candidate for mission-critical applications that must manage XML data. 
        </p>
      <p>
            Important features that BDB XML inherits from Berkeley DB are:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    In-process data access. BDB XML is compiled in the same way as
                    any library. It runs in the same process space as your
                    application. The result is database support in a small
                    footprint without the IPC-overhead required by
                    traditional client/server-based database
                    implementations.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Ability to manage databases up to 256 terabytes in size.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Database environment support. BDB XML environments
                    support all of the same features as Berkeley DB
                    environments, including multiple databases,
                    shared data cache,
                    transactions, deadlock detection,
                    lock and page control,
                    and encryption.  In particular, this means that BDB XML
                    databases can share an environment with Berkeley DB
                    databases, thus allowing an application to gracefully
                    use both.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Atomic operations. Complex sequences of read and write
                    access can be grouped together into a single atomic
                    operation using BDB XML's transaction support.  Either
                    all of the read and write operations within a
                    transaction succeed, or none of them succeed.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Isolated operations. Operations performed inside a
                    transaction see all XML documents as if no other
                    transactions are currently operating on them.  
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Recoverability. BDB XML's transaction support ensures
                    that all committed data is available no matter how the
                    application or system might subsequently fail. 
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                        Concurrent access. Through the combined use of
                        isolation mechanisms built into BDB XML, plus
                        deadlock handling supplied by the application,
                        multiple threads and processes can concurrently
                        access the XML data set in a safe manner.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Replication. BDB XML provides the ability to distribute 
                    updates made to a master database
                    to multiple replica databases. This provides the application 
                    with the ability to support fail-over for
                    High Availability applications, as well as scalability 
                    for load balancing of queries across multiple systems.
