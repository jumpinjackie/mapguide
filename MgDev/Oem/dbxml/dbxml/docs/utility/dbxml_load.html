<b><pre>dbxml_load [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-f file</b>] [<b>-h home</b>] [<b>-P password</b>] xml_container</pre></b>
<b>Description</b>
<a name="2"><!--meow--></a>
<p>The dbxml_load utility reads from the standard input and loads
it into the XML container <b>xml_container</b>.  The XML container
<b>xml_container</b> is created if it does not already exist.</p>
<p>The input to dbxml_load must be in the output format specified
by the <a href="../utility/dbxml_dump.html">dbxml_dump</a> utility.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<br>
<b>-f</b><ul compact><li>Read from the specified <b>file</b> instead of from the standard
input.</ul>
<b>-h</b><ul compact><li>Specify a home directory for the database environment.
<p>If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened
using the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>, <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a>,
<a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>, <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a>, and <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON">DB_USE_ENVIRON</a>
flags to UNREF==dbenv_open.  (This means that dbxml_load can
be used to load data into XML containers while they are in use by
other processes.) If the UNREF==dbenv_open call fails, or if no home
directory is specified, the XML container is still updated, but the
environment is ignored; for example, no locking is done.</p></ul>
<b>-P</b><ul compact><li>Specify an environment password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</ul>
<b>-V</b><ul compact><li>Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.</ul>
<br>
<p>The dbxml_load utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
<b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or
because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a
Berkeley DB environment, dbxml_load should always be given the chance to
detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause dbxml_load
to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an
interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>
<p>The dbxml_load utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more
key/data pairs were not loaded into the XML container because the key
already existed, and &gt;1 if an error occurs.</p>
<br><b>Environment Variables</b>
<br>
<b>DB_HOME</b><ul compact><li>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in UNREF==dbenv_open.</ul>
