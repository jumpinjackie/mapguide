<b><pre>dbxml_dump [<b>-NRrV</b>] [<b>-f output</b>] [<b>-h home</b>] [<b>-P password</b>] xml_container</pre></b>
<b>Description</b>
<a name="2"><!--meow--></a>
<p>The dbxml_dump utility reads the XML container in file
<b>file</b> and writes it to the standard output using a portable
flat-text format understood by the <a href="../utility/dbxml_load.html">dbxml_load</a> utility.  The
argument <b>xml_container</b> must be a file produced using the Berkeley DB XML library
functions.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<br>
<b>-f</b><ul compact><li>Write to the specified <b>file</b> instead of to the standard
output.</ul>
<b>-h</b><ul compact><li>Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.</ul>
<b>-N</b><ul compact><li>Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running.  Other problems,
such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well.
This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be
used under any other circumstances.</ul>
<b>-P</b><ul compact><li>Specify an environment password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</ul>
<b>-R</b><ul compact><li>Aggressively salvage data from a possibly corrupt file.  The
<b>-R</b> flag differs from the <b>-r</b> option in that it will
return all possible data from the file at the risk of also returning
already deleted or otherwise nonsensical items.  Data dumped in this
fashion will almost certainly have to be edited by hand or other means
before the data is ready for reload into another XML container</ul>
<b>-r</b><ul compact><li>Salvage data from a possibly corrupt file.  When used on a uncorrupted
XML container, this option should return equivalent data to a normal
dump, but most likely in a different order.</ul>
<b>-V</b><ul compact><li>Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.</ul>
<br>
<p>The dbxml_dump utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
<b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or
because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a
Berkeley DB environment, dbxml_dump should always be given the chance to
detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause dbxml_dump
to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an
interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>
<p>Even when using a Berkeley DB database environment, the dbxml_dump
utility does not use any kind of database locking if it is invoked
with the <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> arguments.   If used with one of
these arguments, the dbxml_dump utility may only be safely run
on XML containers that are not being modified by any other process;
otherwise, the output may be corrupt.</p>
<p>The dbxml_dump utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
<br><b>Environment Variables</b>
<br>
<b>DB_HOME</b><ul compact><li>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in UNREF==dbenv_open.</ul>
