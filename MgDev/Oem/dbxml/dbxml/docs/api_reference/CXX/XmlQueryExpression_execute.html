<b>Description: XmlQueryExpression::execute</b>
<p>Evaluates (runs) an XQuery query that was previously prepared by
<a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlManager_prepare.html">XmlManager::prepare</a> and returns an <a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlResults.html">XmlResults</a> set.</p>
<p>There are two basic forms of this method: one that takes an
<a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlValue.html">XmlValue</a> object, and another that does not. For methods that do
not take an XmlValue, the XQuery must restrict the scope of the query
using either the collection() or the doc() XQuery navigation functions,
or an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>For those forms of this method that take an <a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlValue.html">XmlValue</a>, the query
is applied against that object.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<b>Description: XmlQueryExpression.execute(
    XmlTransaction &txn, XmlQueryContext &queryContext, u_int32_t flags = 0)</b>
<p>Evaluates the XQuery expression against the containers and documents
identified by the query, from within the scope of the provided
<a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlTransaction.html">XmlTransaction</a> object..</p>
<b>Parameters</b> <br>
 <b>txn</b><ul compact><li>If the operation is to be transaction-protected, the <b>txn</b>
parameter is an <a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlTransaction.html">XmlTransaction</a> handle returned from
<a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlManager_createTransaction.html">XmlManager::createTransaction</a>.</ul>
 <b>queryContext</b><ul compact><li>The <a href="../../api_reference/CXX/XmlQueryContext.html">XmlQueryContext</a> to use for this evaluation.</ul>
 <b>flags</b><ul compact><li>The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to 0 or by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one
or more of the following values:
<br>
<b><a name="DB_READ_COMMITTED">DB_READ_COMMITTED</a></b><ul compact><li>This operation will have degree 2 isolation.  This provides for cursor
stability but not repeatable reads.  Data items which have been
previously read by this transaction may be deleted or modified by other
transactions before this transaction completes.
</ul>
<b><a name="DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a></b><ul compact><li>This operation will support degree 1 isolation; that is, read operations
may return data that has been modified by other transactions but which
has not yet been committed.
Silently ignored if the <a href="../../api_reference/CXX/dbopen.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag 
was not specified when the underlying container was opened.
</ul>
<b><a name="DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a></b><ul compact><li>Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the read, if
locking is configured.  Setting this flag can eliminate deadlock during
a read-modify-write cycle by acquiring the write lock during the read
part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring a read
lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will not
result in deadlock.
</ul>
<b><a name="DBXML_LAZY_DOCS">DBXML_LAZY_DOCS</a></b><ul compact><li>Retrieve the document lazily. That is, retrieve document content and
document metadata only on an as needed basis when reading the document.</ul>
<b><a name="DBXML_DOCUMENT_PROJECTION">DBXML_DOCUMENT_PROJECTION</a></b><ul compact><li>When parsing a document in order to execute a query, use static analysis
of the query to materialize only those portions of
the document relevant to the query.  This can significantly enhance
performance of queries against documents from containers of type XmlContainer::WholedocContainer and documents not in a container.  It should not be used if arbitrary navigation of the resulting nodes is
to be performed, as not all nodes in the original document will be present and unexepcted results
could be returned.  This flag has no effect on documents in containers of 
type XmlContainer::NodeContainer.</ul>
<b><a name="DBXML_WELL_FORMED_ONLY">DBXML_WELL_FORMED_ONLY</a></b><ul compact><li>Force the use of a scanner that will neither validate nor read
schema or dtds associated with the document during parsing.  This
is efficient, but can cause parsing errors if the document references
information that might have come from a schema or dtd, such as entity
references.</ul>
<b><a name="DBXML_NO_AUTO_COMMIT">DBXML_NO_AUTO_COMMIT</a></b><ul compact><li>Do not create and automatically commit a transaction if one is not provided to this method. A query that
performs an update under a transactional environment will automatically be transaction protected unless
this flag is specified. This flag is only necessary if the update will make changes to both transactional
and non-transactional containers.</ul>
