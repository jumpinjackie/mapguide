Python module for the Berkeley DB XML library.
Copyright (c) 2003,2009 Oracle.  All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION
------------

This module is built using SWIG (http://www.swig.org) to produce a
Python module that maps to the Berkeley DB XML C++ API fairly closely.
At present, separate documentation for the Python API is not provided.
Refer to the C++ API documentation and the Python examples for more
information.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------

To build and install this module, you first need:

  * A working C++ compiler

  * Python 2.3 or newer (preferably @PYREL@)

  * a working build of Berkeley DB XML compiled with the same C++
    compiler as Python.

  * an installed version of the bsddb3 Python module that supports 
    Berkeley DB 4.3 or higher.  As of early 2008 this project has moved
    from http://pybsddb.sourceforge.net to
    http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm

    Note: the bsddb3 module has been accepted into the Python core, and 
    ships with Python 2.3 and above.  Also note that this module 
    must be compiled against the same version of Berkeley DB you 
    are building Berkeley DB XML against.  Python generally includes
    a Berkeley DB release, but that release may or may not be 
    sufficient for BDB XML, which requires at least Berkeley DB 4.3,
    and higher releases for advanced features.
    See below for further instructions.

This module uses the standard Python distutils to control building and
installing into the Python tree.

BUILDING bsddb3 module
----------------------

If you have already built and installed a version of the bsddb3
Python module against the same version of Berkeley DB used to 
build BDB XML, you can skip to the next section.

For convenience, a current, known-working version of the pybsddb 
project is included with this distribution.  It is
in the directory, src/python/@PYBSDDB_REL@ (or a path very
similar), and can support Berkeley DB through at least release 
@DB_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DB_VERSION_MINOR@.

These instructions assume that you have built BDB XML into its default
location.  If that is not the case, you may need to edit the setup files,
or add flags such as --berkeley-db=<path-to-db-install>.
A customized setup file (setup.dbxml.py) that is tailored
to the BDB XML build tree is provided.

1.  cd @PYBSDDB_REL@
2.  Build:
    python setup.dbxml.py build [--debug]
3.  Install (may require extra privilege):
    python setup.dbxml.py install
4.  cd ..

BUILDING the dbxml module
-------------------------
   
1. Build (in the directory containing this README file):
    python setup.py [--with-bsddb=@PYBSDDB_REL@] build [--debug]
or if you do not have bsddb3 source available
    python setup.py build [--debug]

2. Install:
    python setup.py install

If there are any problems, ensure that setup.py is correct.  
The key variables are:
  db_home, xerces_home, and xquery_home
    a.  Unix.  The variables should be correct, based
    on your input to the dist/configure script, which modifies
    the setup.py file.  They can be modified by using --with-<module>=<path>
    options when executing setup.py.  See setup.py for details.

    b.  Windows.  The values for the variables are based
    on the default installation.  If your installation is not
    default, hand edit setup.py to reflect the actual locations
    of the products.

Note: the variables are primarily used to locate the libraries
BDB XML requires for linking, and not for include file locations.
 
TESTING and examples
--------------------

1. If you want to test before installing, you will need to build and set
PYTHONPATH to include the build directory, src/python/build/lib.*.
If you have built the bsddb3 module, also include the directory,
src/python/build/@PYBSDDB_REL@/build/lib.*

2.  Verify correct versions.  First, be sure that
you have the correct versions of Berkeley DB and BDB XML
installed.  In order to do this, run these commands in
a script, or interactively, using python.  Output here is
assuming BDB XML @DBXML_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DBXML_VERSION_MINOR@.@DBXML_VERSION_PATCH@:
  python
  >>> from bsddb3.db import *
  >>> from dbxml import *
  >>> print version()
  (4, 8, 11)    ### output must be the version of DB bundled with BDB XML
  >>> mgr=XmlManager()
  >>> print mgr.get_version_string()
  Oracle: Berkeley DB XML 2.4.x: (<some date>)
  	    ### output should look like above, where the
	    ### version is 2.4.x

NOTE: if you are using BDB XML @DBXML_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DBXML_VERSION_MINOR@.@DBXML_VERSION_PATCH@ and version() 
indicates something other than DB @DB_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DB_VERSION_MINOR@.@DB_VERSION_PATCH@ and you have not built that DB version yourself, your build of
pybsddb probably found another incompatible release of Berkeley DB,
and you'll have problems.

3.  There are Python examples in the directory examples/python in the top of the
Berkeley DB XML tree.  Once this module is installed, the examples can
be run in that directory with:

    python examples.py test
to run all examples, or
    python examples.py <test_number (1-13)>
to run a single example.

Test number 7 is a good one to try to be sure that your BDB XML
and Berkeley DB libraries are correct and compatible.
