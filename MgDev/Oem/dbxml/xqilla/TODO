Features
--------

Complete XQuery Fulltext support
XQueryP support
XQuery 1.1 Grouping support
Complete XSLT 2.0 support
Support pre-parsed modules
Improve exceptions heirachy, and implement XQuery 1.1 try/catch
Implement EXSLT math functions


Optimization
------------

Hash map implementation of distinct-values()
nested loop elimination (group recognition, join recognition)
common sub-expression extraction
faster modifiable data model
Document projection for recursive functions
pull event execution
Remove and free unused global variables
Better static typing esp. for higher order functions


Infrastructure
--------------

query plan output using event API
string pool that returns numeric identifier
support for UTF-8 execution?
extract basic schema types from Xerces-C
abstract schema type access (no direct access to Xerces objects)
Improve MAPM concurrency
Windows -- re-enable warning 4996 (xqilla_config.h) and address the "unsafe" warnings
	for use of strcat, strcpy, etc
Write query plans to byte code, and execute the byte code in a virtual machine
Save out parsed query to disk


QA
--

fix UTF-16 bugs
fix XQTS bugs
new test suite
test XQuery Fulltext
Fix ATDoubleOrDerivedImpl and ATFloatOrDerivedImpl to use double and float types
Make xs:decimal infinite length
Fix numeric output methods to use variable size buffers
Fix module import to work correctly, including:
  - using the correct static context
  - returning known schema types
  - checking import circularities correctly


Query Prepare Optimization
--------------------------

Rewrite DatatypeLookup to be cheaper and more efficient - maybe write our own primitive type handling?
DocumentCacheImpl is expensive to create, maybe don't always create a scanner? Maybe handle primitive schema types ourselves?
