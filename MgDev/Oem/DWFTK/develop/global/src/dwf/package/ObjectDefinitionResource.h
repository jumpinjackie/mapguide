///             This resource class is slightly different from the others in the toolkit
///             in that it is only ever created by the publishing application.
///             This allows the publisher to associate different object definitions
///             with other resources in the same section; specifically, in most cases,
///             tying object instances to graphic nodes.
///
///\todo        While resources of this type are not created by the parsing process due
///             to efficiency issues (on-demand object/property resolution), it might
///             be more consistent to merge this object and the DWFObjectDefinition together.
