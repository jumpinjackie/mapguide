///\brief       This is a plug-in filter for DWFXMLCallback implementations that removes
///             duplicated element attributes in malformed XML streams.
///\since       7.0.1
///
///             Certain older versions of AutoCAD (e.g. 2002)
///             are known to produce section descriptor documents
///             with malformed XML, in particular, duplicating the <i>xmlns:EPlot</i> attribute.
///             The DWFXMLCallback interface provides the \a setStreamFilter() method for hooking up a filter
///             between the document source and the XML parser.
///             This filter implementation detects and discards duplicate attributes.
///
///\warning     First, filtering slows the read/parse process considerably, testing shows
///             anyhere from 9% - 31% over a small sample set, your mileage may vary.
///
///\warning     Second, the algorthim was developed with the above mentioned problem in mind,
///             as such, it may or may not really fix super bad XML, but then, it's not really
///             supposed to...
