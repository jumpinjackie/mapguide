///\brief       This is the plug-in interface for the DWFPackageWriter.
///\since       7.0.1
///
///             This interface is intended to be used to modify the publish-time
///             behavior of the DWFPackageWriter; specifically to capture and
///             implement version-specific differences in the DWF.  
///             As a general rule, version variations may be created to support
///             a new feature or introduce new functionality.  Eventually, these
///             might be removed from the format entirely but the ability
///             to produce the package variations must continue to exist.
///
///             The interface works by mimicking some of the DWFPackageWriter interface.
///             The writer, when used with an extension, will first make the matching
///             call on the extension. This methods must return a boolean value
///             that communicates the continuation intent back to the writer.  
///             If \e true, the writer will continue to process its own call path after
///             returning from the extension.
///             If \e false, the writer will return immediately from its own call path
///             after returning from the extension.
