///\since       7.2.0
///
///             Collections of related properties can be stored in a DWFPropertySet. Property
///             sets can also contain other property sets. \e Open property sets on content
///             elements allow their properties to be directly visible as properties of the
///             element. Properties of a \e closed set can only be accessed by directly
///             querying the set for the properties it contains. If a property set is closed
///             then any subsets it contains will effectively be closed in that queries
///             will not reach them unless the main set is explicitly queried, or the query
///             is told to disregard the closed set flag.
