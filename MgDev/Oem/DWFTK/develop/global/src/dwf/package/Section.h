///             <b>Section Descriptors</b>\par
///             While the package manifest outlines general section information,
///             it is the section's descriptor that provides the details.
///             The section classes in the toolkit are structured for highly
///             efficient processing.  As such, the descriptors are never 
///             automatically loaded.  On-demand descriptor parsing allows for
///             the most flexibility when processing an entire DWF package.
///             That said, it is very strongly recommended that a section's descriptor
///             is read into the DWFSection object before using it's data and resources;
///             especially when copying or moving resources between sections.
