//! Handles transfer of certain unaligned bit lengths via unsigned char arrays
/*! 
    We determined that visual artifacts introduced in sending 8-bit
    normals were too noticeable, and that higher accuracy was required.
    At the same time, however, we wanted better compression than 16-bit.
    Thus, the BByteStream class was born.

    For efficiency, this class makes certain assumptions about the
    number of bits per pixel: 1) that samples are at least 1 byte 
    (see logic controlling byteplace incrementing); 2) that samples
    never span 3 bytes in the character array (ruling out lengths of
    11, 13, 14, 15, and 17+.  Additionally, the bit shifting operations
    here are needless overhead for any length divisible by 8, meaning
    that this class is not the best way to do it.  These
    assumptions and observations restrict us (at least for the moment)
    to 9, 10, and 12 as allowable sample lengths.

    This class is a state machine that is intended to match the semantics
    of a FILE* (with the obvious exception that it goes into a uchar*
    rather than to a real file.  With that in mind, it does not support
    random access through the data.  Only a linear walk from front to back
    is allowed.
