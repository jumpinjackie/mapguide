//! Handles the TKE_PolyPolyline opcode.
/*! 
    TK_Polypoint provides support for writing/reading the TKE_PolyPolyline opcode objects to/from an 
    HSF file. 
    
    TKE_PolyPolyline is an alternative to TKE_Polyline and TKE_Line.  It is a more compressed way of handling 
    large numbers of polylines and lines.  The idea is that by grouping primitives together, better 
    compression algorithms can be run for  them.  This class utilizes some of the same compression schemes 
    that are implemented in TK_Shell.

    This class is especially optimal for dealing with 2d data.  With all of the 12 combinations ("zero", "constant", 
    "per-primitive" or "unrestricted" along any of the 3 standard axes X, Y and/or Z), we leverage the restrictions that
    we can make to compress as deeply as possible.  There is no provision for point data that is "mostly" 2d, however, 
    so such data will be encoded as 3d.  For this reason, performance will improve if all 2d lines and polylines can be
    put in a segment or segments that are separate from any 3d line data.
    
    The HOOPS/3dGS scene-graph supports 'polyline' and 'polygon' primitives which are both defined by a point count 
    and points array.
