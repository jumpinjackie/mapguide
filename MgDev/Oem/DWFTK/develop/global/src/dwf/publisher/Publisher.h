///\brief       Base implementation and interface defintion for objects (publishers) that
///             can process and publish known content.
///\since       7.0.1
///
///             Publisher objects are used to extract data from publishable structural constructs (Model, etc.)
///             A publisher can be configured with strong type visitors that will be called upon
///             as the structure is traversed.  Complex and compound visitors can be created
///             for additional functionality.  For example, a compound DWFPublishedObject visitor could be used
///             to insert a record in a database for every "object" in the structure. 
///             Another is as a base class for a aggregate object that additionally
///             implements whatever visitor interfaces it needs.  This solution is preferrable if common data
///             must be shared across visitors.  
///
///             The basic publishing workflow is as follows:
///             -# Create an instance of a [derived type] DWFPublisher (DWFPackagePublisher is an example implementation.)
///             -# Create an instance of a [derived type] DWFPublishableSection (DWFModel is an example implementation.)
///             -# Add content (DWFPublishable types) to the section.
///             -# Pass the publisher to the \a publish() method of the section.  The publisher will process the section
///                content according to its implementation details.
///             -# Invoke the \a publish() method on the publisher.  This will complete the process.
///
///             For a more advanced workflow, repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 above to add multiple sections to the final publication.
///
///\note        It should be obvious but there is nothing requiring a DWFPublisher to actually produce a DWF package file.
///             A reference implementation (DWFPackagePublisher) is provided with the toolkit.
