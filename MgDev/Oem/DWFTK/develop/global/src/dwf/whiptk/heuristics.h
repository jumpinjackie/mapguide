     *  This happens when the object has been materialized, or
     *  the operand has been skipped.  Normally, in a non-deferred
     *  state, if the object hasn't been materialized,
     *  WT_File::get_next_object_shell() takes care of skipping the current
     *  (non-materialized) object's operand and thus advancing the
     *  file pointer, by using WT_Object::skip_operand().  However,
     *  in the deferred delete state, it's possible that the client
     *  has already deleted the current object before
     *  get_next_object_shell() is called, so we avoid calling
     *  the methods on the current object to discover whether or not
     *  it is materialized.  Thus, the file pointer will not
     *  automatically get advanced in that case.  The suggested usage
     *  by clients using deferred_delete is to either always use
     *  WT_File::get_next_object(), which always materializes the
     *  object and thus advances the file pointer - or to make sure
     *  the operand is skipped if the object is not materialized.
