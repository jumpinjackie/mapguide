/// Used by WT_Fill_Pattern and WT_Line_Pattern as an internal WT_Option defining the scale of the respective pattern.
/** Specifies the scale factor (muliplier) for the pattern.  There are three different types of
 *  pattern scales:
 *  \li Values greater than 0.0 indicate the pattern scales with geometry (as you zoom in the
 *  pattern spreads out). The value defines the number of drawing units over which one repetition
 *  of the line pattern will occur. Thus if a pattern scale of 50.0 is applied to a line 100
 *  logical units long, then the line pattern will repeat two times over the length of the line.
 *  \li When the pattern scale is 0.0 (the default), this means that a rendering application should
 *  default to an aesthetically reasonable device-relative scale value.
 *  \li Values less than 0.0 mean that the provided scale is to be measured in device coordinates
 *  (and thus doesn't change with a viewer's zoom factor). The value defines the number of device
 *  pixels (not drawing units) over which the pattern repeats.
