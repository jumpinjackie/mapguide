 *  Working with international text is not as straightforward as it may seem. It may help to
 *  know a little about character encoding and display before using international text in WHIP!
 *  data. These notes are provided as a brief overview of supporting international text.
 *
 *  <b>Using International Character Sets</b>
 *
 *  Text characters are written to a file as either single-byte characters, double-byte characters,
 *  or both single and double-byte character sets. The method used to encode characters usually
 *  depends on the written local language of the operating system.  English has a relatively small
 *  character set of only 256 written characters. The 256 English characters are commonly referred
 *  to as the ASCII character set. ASCII characters can each be represented in one byte (8 bits) of
 *  computer memory. ASCII has a limited number of characters, but most written languages have many
 *  more characters than 256. As a result, international languages (other than English) must be
 *  represented using two byte (16 bits) character sets.
 *
 *  \note Although computer applications could simply represent all languages using two bytes of
 *  memory per character, this is not done for the English character set since the characters would
 *  consume twice as much memory as is needed using ASCII , and resulting file sizes would be
 *  unnecessarily large.
 *
 *  Using international character sets is complicated by the fact that there are two different ways
 *  to encode multiple bytes of computer memory for text: Unicode and Multi-Byte Character Set (MBCS):
 *
 *  \li Unicode is a map of characters in which each character corresponds to a unique two byte value.
 *  The Unicode character map contains characters from most of the world's languages.  Unicode character
 *  values are always two bytes and there is only one mapping such that a given number always maps to the
 *  same character on every computer using Unicode.
 *  \li Multi-Byte Character Sets (MBCS) are code pages, or maps, between written characters and either
 *  one byte or two byte numbers. As a result, a string with several MBCS characters can have both single
 *  and double-byte characters. Unlike Unicode, one number is not unique to one character. When using MBCS,
 *  a given number might correspond to a Chinese character when using a Chinese character set, or it might
 *  correspond to a Japanese character when using a Japanese character set.
 *
 *  Another difference between MBCS and Unicode is that different MBCS platforms (such as Unix, Microsoft
 *  Windows, or Macintosh) may have different character sets for the same written language. For example,
 *  when using MBCS a given number might map to a Japanese character on Japanese Windows, but the same
 *  number may map to another character on English Windows.
 *
 *  <b>Operating Systems and International Characters</b>
 *
 *  Another consideration in supporting international characters is that different operating systems
 *  support different character encoding methods. For example, Windows NT/2000/XP fully support both Unicode
 *  and MBCS, but Windows9x fully supports MBCS, and only partially supports Unicode. To maximize the
 *  efficiency with which WHIP! operates, and to ensure the smallest possible file size, the strategy for
 *  WHIP! data is:
 *  \li Text strings containing only ASCII characters are stored in WHIP! files as ASCII.  By using one
 *  byte instead of two, file size remains small.
 *  \li Text strings containing multi-byte characters are stored in WHIP! files as Unicode. This is the
 *  most flexible and universal approach for ensuring that WHIP! data works now and in the future. This
 *  also enables WHIP! data to be used on non-Microsoft operating systems.
