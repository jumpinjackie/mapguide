/** \addtogroup groupRenditionAttributes
 *  @{
 *  Describes the User_Hatch_Pattern attribute in the file Rendition to be applied to 
 *  subsequent Polygons and other filled geometry. 
 *  This attribute is a user defined collection of Parrallel Line sets that is used 
 *  by all the drawing opcodes that are affected by the Fill attribute. 
 *  The attribute itself can be used in various ways. 
 *  a) Only by defining a previously defined Hash pattern num - 
 *     This allows the reuse of a Hatch Pattern attribute that was defined earlier in the file 
 *     by specifing the same Hash pattern number it used.
 *  b) By Defining a unique Hash pattern number along with the X and Y size in points
 *     (i.e. pixel size on the screen) of how often the defined pattern repeats.
 *     Note: The Line set simply consists of a defualt straight line pattern.
 *  c) By Defining a unique Hash pattern number, X, Y values and any given number of 
 *     reference counted Hatch_Pattern objects. 
 *  Its important to note that the usage of this class differs from other "heavy"
 *  attributes such as WT_Line_Pattern. Each custom parralel line specification is constructed
 *  by using the reference counted inner class, Hatch_Pattern. The use of reference counting
 *  makes the copying of the attribute a relatively cheap affair. 
 *  However, it is important that access to the reference counted object be properly controlled 
 *  by setting the reference count correctly or using a suitable smart pointer. 
 *  DWFCore provides one such "smart pointer" in the guise of the 
 *  DWFCore::DWFCountedObjectPointer.
