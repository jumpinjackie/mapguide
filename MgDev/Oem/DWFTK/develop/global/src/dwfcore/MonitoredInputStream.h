///\brief       An input stream whose read operation can be "watched".
///\since       1.0.1
///
///             This implementation of the DWFInputStream is useful when it is
///             desriable for one entity to passively receive the same data 
///             as the active stream reader.  There are two mechanisms provided for hooking
///             into the stream: an object may implement the Monitor interface,
///             or DWFOutputStream.  In both cases, whatever data was obtained during
///             the \a read() operation will be either posted to the monitor or written
///             into the output stream.
///
///             Example 1: Use a monitor to show progress:
///             \code
///             class ProgressMonitor : public DWFMonitoredInputStream::Monitor
///             {
///                 ProgressMonitor( size_t nTotalBytesInStream )
///                     : _nTotalBytes( nTotalBytesInStream )
///                     , _nBytesReadSoFar( 0 )
///                 {;}
///                 
///                 void notify( const void* const pBuffer,
///                              size_t            nBytesRequested,
///                              size_t            nBytesRead )
///                     throw( DWFException )
///                 {
///                     _nBytesReadSoFar += nBytesRead;
///                     float nProgress = 100.0 * (float)(_nBytesReadSoFar / _nTotalBytesInStream);
///
///                     _send_progress_function( nProgress );
///                 }
///             };
///             \endcode
///
///             Example 2: Copy a stream into a temporary file.
///             \code
///             DWFString zTemplate( L"_dwfcore_" );
///
///             //
///             // passing true as the second parameter will result in the
///             // temporary disk file being deleted when the DWFTempFile
///             // object is destroyed.
///             //
///             DWFTempFile* pTempFile = DWFTempFile::Create( zTemplate, true );
///             DWFOutputStream* pTempFileStream = pTempFile->getOuputStream();
///
///             //
///             // passing true here tells the monitor stream to assume
///             // ownership of the file stream and delete it when
///             // he is deleted himself
///             //
