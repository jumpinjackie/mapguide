///\brief           This class provides a high resolution hardware-based timer.
///\since           1.0.1
///\note            This class has platform-specific implementations.
///\ingroup         CrossPlatformImpl
///
///                 This class most basically provides access to a raw cpu tick count.
///                 Using this 64-bit value, it then provides simple stopwatch-like
///                 functionality for measuring code execution.
///                 Since the class declaration is the same for all platforms,
///                 it (and the values it provides) can be used in portable
///                 code.  Further, these values are more accurate for measuring
///                 events that occur under the millisecond threshhold where using
///                 certain OS-specific APIs would not suffice.
///                 It is preferrable to use these numbers and convert them into milliseconds
///                 (or some other unit) if the need arises.  The following sample is one
///                 such method:
///
///                 Example - convert high resultion cpu ticks into milliseconds:
///                 \code
