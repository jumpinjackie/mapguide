///\example     Files/Files.cpp
///             This sample program exercises a variety of file operations including streaming I/O,
///             zip archiving and processing using several file-oriented core classes and interfaces
///             including: 
///                 - DWFCore::DWFFile
///                 - DWFCore::DWFTempFile
///                 - DWFCore::DWFFileInputStream
///                 - DWFCore::DWFFileOutputStream
///                 - DWFCore::DWFZipFileDescriptor
///                 - DWFCore::DWFStreamFileDescriptor
///
///             Also shown in this example are other useful concepts such as timing operations,
///             string usage, and stream buffering and monitoring using the following core classes
///             and interfaces:
///                 - DWFCore::DWFTimer
///                 - DWFCore::DWFString
///                 - DWFCore::DWFException
///                 - DWFCore::DWFBufferOutputStream
