///\section     synch           Synchronization Objects
///             The synchronization objects provided by the core library all require platform-specific
///             interface definitions in addition to their implementations.  The DWFCore::DWFSynchronization
///             interface does define a platform-independent contract for locking functionality and should be 
///             used if possible in cross-platform code.
///             Also, the Synchronization.h header file will include the correct header files for the current
///             platform and included be used instead of the individual headers themselves.
///
///             The manner in which these classes were defined in this version of the library
///             prevents Doxygen from fully documenting their various implementations.  
///             So for this release only, the documentation will be taken from the Win32 versions.
///             Note that the actual public class interfaces and identical for all platforms.
///

///
///\example     Threads/Threads.cpp
///             This sample program illustrates basic thread usage and control using several
///             core synchronization classes and interfaces including:
///                 - DWFCore::DWFThreadMutex
///                 - DWFCore::DWFThreadPool
///                     - DWFCore::DWFThreadPool::Controller
///                 - DWFCore::DWFThreadWorker
///
///             Other concepts like exception handling and timestamping are shown using
///             the following classes:
///                 - DWFCore::DWFTimer
///                 - DWFCore::DWFException
