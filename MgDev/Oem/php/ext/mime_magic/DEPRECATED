This extension is deprecated, please use the fileinfo extension
from PECL instead.

Back when i implemented mime_magic there was no library interface
to the file utilities functionality. The only way to get the 
functionality in place was to get the file sources and replace
the input and output routines within with code interfacing to
your own stuff. This work was originally done by the developers
of apache mod_magic, the mime_magic extension just replaced the
apache specific parts with their PHP counterparts.

Now that the codebase of the file utilities is cleanly devided 
into the libmagic library and the file utility built upon it
the original hack is no longer needed. Using libmagic and the
fileinfo extension does not only provide a cleaner interface
to files functionality but also additional functionality so 
that theres no reason to keep around mime_magic anymore.

To keep existing code originaly coded for mime_magic without
changes you may add the following compatibility wrapper function
to your codebase:

function mime_content_type($file) {
    static $finfo = false;

    if ($finfo === false) {
        $finfo = finfo_open(MAGIC_MIME);
    }

	if (is_resource($file)) {
		$buf = fread($fp, 65536);
		return finfo_buffer($buf);
    } else {
	    return finfo_file($file);
    }
}
