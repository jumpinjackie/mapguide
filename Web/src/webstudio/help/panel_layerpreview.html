<h1>Layer Preview Panel</h1>
<p>The layer preview panel shows a preview of the layer in an embedded copy of the AJAX Viewer.  Due to restrictions in the javascript security model, it is not possible to programmatically refresh the preview when the layer style changes.  At this time, you must save a layer, close it and re-open it to regenerate the preview.</p>
