  <h2><span class="orange">1.</span> Find Data</h2>

  <p>MapGuide references data through Feature Sources.  There are two ways of loading file-based data into a Feature Source: Uploading managed data and referencing unmanaged data.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><img src="images/tree_data.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Feature Source" title="Feature Source">
        <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('concept_featuresource.html#managed')">Upload Data into a new Feature Source</a></dt>
    <dd>Create new Feature Source and upload .SHP or .SDF data files into it.  The data will then be managed by MapGuide.</dd>

    <dt><img src="images/tree_data.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Feature Source" title="Feature Source">
        <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('concept_featuresource.html#unmanaged')">Reference Unmanaged Data in a new Feature Source</a></dt>
    <dd>Create a new Feature Source and reference .SHP or .SDF data files.  If files are already on the server, but not managed by MapGuide they can be referenced by providing the path to the data.  The data will remain unmanaged by MapGuide, but will be available to make layers and maps.</dd>

  <h2><span class="orange">2.</span> Build Layers</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><img src="images/tree_layer.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Layer" title="Layer">
        <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('concept_layer.html')">Create a new Layer</a></dt>
    <dd>Layers add style to the data.  Feature Sources need to be linked to Layers so the data can be styled.  Layers can be themed and labeled by data attributes to give them meaning.  They can be themed and labeled by scale also to control their appearance at any scale.</dd>

  <h2><span class="orange">3.</span> Make a Map</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><img src="images/tree_map.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Map" title="Map">
        <a href="javascript:setHelpTopic('concept_map.html')">Create a new Map</a></dt>
    <dd>Maps are a collection of Layers.  Once styled, Layers can be used together to build up a map.  Layers should be put in order, with points on top, lines next, and polygons and rasters on the bottom.</dd>
