Berkeley DB XML Java API<br>
<a href="{@docRoot}/%2e%2e/ref_xml/toc.html" target="_top">[reference guide]</a>.
<p>
This package is a wrapper around the Berkeley DB XML library.  It uses
JNI to provide access to Berkeley DB XML, which is implemented in C++.
That means that a shared library or DLL must be available when
applications use this package.
<p>
There are also several utilities provided with Berkeley DB XML that make
administrative tasks possible from the command line.  For more
information, see the page <a href="{@docRoot}/../utility/index.html"
target="_top">Berkeley DB XML Supporting Utilities</a>.
