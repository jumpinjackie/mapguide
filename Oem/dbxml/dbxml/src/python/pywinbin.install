		Installing and Using Python Binaries

Requirements
------------

1.  ActivePython 2.5.x must be properly installed on your system

Install
-------

1. execute bsddb3-4.8.1.win32-py2.5.exe 
   -- installs the Berkeley DB (bsddb3) module
2. execute dbxml-2.5.16.win32-py2.5.exe
   -- installs the Berkeley DB XML module

The executables above include all of the dependent libraries so it is 
not necessary to install either of the core runtime libraries. Only a 
Release version of the Python libraries is available. The installation 
will fail if Python 2.5 is not installed on the target machine.

Python example programs, if installed, can be found in 
<InstallDir>/dbxml/examples/python. A simple smoke test that can be 
done after installation is running the Python example script 
<InstallDir>/dbxml/examples/python/basic/helloWorld.py. 
If this works then your installation is good.
