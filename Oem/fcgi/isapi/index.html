Changes:<br>

<ul>11/03/2002 0.6
<li>fix extra path_info handling</li>

<ul>03/17/2002 0.5
<li>Special thanks to Jim Hurd for serveral fixes</li>
<li>fixed post handling</li>
<li>fixed socket connection error handling</li>
<li>fixed cleanup post temp files after request</li>
<li>fixed header support for setting redirects or http error status</li>
<li>implemented asynchronous read ahead of large post data (over 48K) in IIS.</li>
<li>implemented security impersonation for IIS on NT based systems.  This
feature enables FastCGI servers to impersonate the security level of the calling
client.  In effect, requests run this way will have the security level of the
authenticated IIS user (anonymous user by default).  In essence, it provides
the same level of security that you would get running a cgi executable.
To have your FastCGI 
applications support this feature, you must currently link against the FastCGI
library provided in the source download.  This feature is supported only for
fastcgi servers executed by this library.  The php fastcgi executable provided
on this page supports this feature, you must set fastcgi.impersonate=1 in php.ini.</li>
<li>HTTP/1.1 Keep Alive support under IIS.  The fastcgi server must send a
content-length to have the fastcgi module signal IIS for keep alive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>03/10/2002
<li>Fix error ouput bug</li>
<li>Fix documentation problem</li>
<li>update to 2.2.2 FastCGI library</li>
