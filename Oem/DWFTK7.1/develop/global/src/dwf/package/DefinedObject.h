///             A defined object is a documented representation of a design component.  These components

///
///             A defined object has no corresponding representation in a DWF graphics stream.
///             That role is taken by the DWFDefinedObjectInstance which is, by definition, the association
///             of a specialized, attributed DWFDefinedObject with a graphical element or node.
///             The role of the DWFDefinedObject is to declare the abstract existence of a design component,
///             outline its relationship among other components and detail its fundamental property interface.
///             Associated instances bind these generalizations with visual data and assign and extend
///             their data definitions.
///
///             These objects exist in a traditional parent-children hierarchical structure with each other.
///             These are structural relationships only; that is, there is no attribute inheritance between
///             a parent and a child as a result of this relationship.
