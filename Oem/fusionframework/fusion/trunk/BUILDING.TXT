Building Fusion

Fusion uses Apache Ant for building and deploying the source code to a web 
server for developers working from the CVS repository.  End users deploying a 
packaged distribution zip file need not worry about building fusion.

Ant is a Java application and therefore Java must be installed on the developers
machine.  Download and install the latest release of Ant (http://ant.apache.org/).
To use Ant, navigate to the directory containing the build.xml file (usually
the root directory of the project) and execute one of the ant targets, e.g.:

> ant deploy

For some tasks, external executable files are used and must be available for 
execution on the PATH environment variable.

This script requires an HTDOCS environment variable be set to point to the
document root directory of your web server.

targets available include:
prepare - creates a "build" subdirectory with all files required to be put on 
          the web server
deploy  - places a copy of the build directory in the web server HTDOCS directory
clean   - removes the temporary build directory
clean-all - executes the clean target and also removes the deployed application
            from the web server
compress  - creates a compressed version of the fusion library
dist      - creates a packaged ZIP file for distribution
docs      - automatically generates class documentation from the source code
