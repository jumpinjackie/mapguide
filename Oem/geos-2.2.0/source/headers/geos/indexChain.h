/*
 * MonotoneChains are a way of partitioning the segments of a linestring to
 * allow for fast searching of intersections.
 * They have the following properties:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the segments within a monotone chain will never intersect each other
 * <li>the envelope of any contiguous subset of the segments in a monotone chain
 * is equal to the envelope of the endpoints of the subset.
 * </ol>
 * Property 1 means that there is no need to test pairs of segments from within
 * the same monotone chain for intersection.
 * Property 2 allows
 * binary search to be used to find the intersection points of two monotone chains.
 * For many types of real-world data, these properties eliminate a large number of
 * segment comparisons, producing substantial speed gains.
 * <p>
 * One of the goals of this implementation of MonotoneChains is to be
 * as space and time efficient as possible. One design choice that aids this
 * is that a MonotoneChain is based on a subarray of a list of points.
 * This means that new arrays of points (potentially very large) do not
 * have to be allocated.
 * <p>
 *
 * MonotoneChains support the following kinds of queries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Envelope select: determine all the segments in the chain which
 * intersect a given envelope
 * <li>Overlap: determine all the pairs of segments in two chains whose
 * envelopes overlap
 * </ul>
 *
 * This implementation of MonotoneChains uses the concept of internal iterators
 * to return the resultsets for the above queries.
 * This has time and space advantages, since it
 * is not necessary to build lists of instantiated objects to represent the segments
 * returned by the query.
 * However, it does mean that the queries are not thread-safe.
