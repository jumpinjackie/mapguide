 * Provides two flags:
 * 
 *  - <b>marked</b> - typically this is used to indicate a state that
 *    persists for the course of the graph's lifetime.  For instance,
 *    it can be used to indicate that a component has been logically
 *    deleted from the graph.
 *  - <b>visited</b> - this is used to indicate that a component has been
 *    processed or visited by an single graph algorithm.  For instance,
 *    a breadth-first traversal of the graph might use this to indicate
 *    that a node has already been traversed.
 *    The visited flag may be set and cleared many times during the
 *    lifetime of a graph.
