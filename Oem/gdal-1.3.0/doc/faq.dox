<title>GDAL FAQ</title>

<ol>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>What's this OGR Stuff?</b><p>

The gdal/ogr tree holds source for a vector IO library inspired by
OpenGIS Simple Features.  In theory it is separate from GDAL, but currently
they reside in the same source tree and are somewhat entangled.  More
information can be found at
<a href="http://ogr.maptools.org/">http://ogr.maptools.org</a>.  It is 
my plan to properly fold OGR into GDAL properly at some point
in the future.  Then GDAL will be a raster and vector library. <p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<li> <b>How do I add support for a new format?</b><p>

To some extent this is now covered by the
<a href="gdal_drivertut.html">GDAL Driver Implementation Tutorial</a>.<p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<li> <b>Can I get a MS Visual Studio Project file for GDAL?</b><p>

The GDAL developers find it more convenient to build with makefiles 
and the Visual Studio NMAKE utility.  Maintaining a parallel set of project
files for GDAL is too much work, so there are no project files directly 
available from the maintainers.  Occationally other users do prepare such 
project files, and you may be able to get them by asking on the gdal-dev list.
However, I would strongly suggest you just use the NMAKE based build system.
With debugging enabled you can still debug into GDAL with Visual Studio.<p>


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<li> <b>Can I build GDAL with Cygwin or MingW?</b>

GDAL should build with Cygwin using the unix style build methodology.  
It is also possible to build with MingW though there are some complications. 
The following might work:<p>

<pre>
./configure --prefix=$PATH_TO_MINGW_ROOT --host=mingw32 \
	--without-libtool --without-python $YOUR_CONFIG_OPTIONS
</pre>

Using external win32 libraries will often be problematic with either of
these environments - at the least requiring some manual hacking of the 
GDALmake.opt file.<p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<li> <b>Can I build GDAL with Borland C or other C compilers?</b>

These are not supported compilers for GDAL; however, GDAL is mostly pretty
generic, so if you are willing to take on the onerous task of building an
appropriate makefile / project file it should be possible.  You will find 
most portability issues in the gdal/port/cpl_port.h file, and you will need
to prepare a gdal/port/cpl_config.h file appropriate to your platform.  Using
cpl_config.h.vc as a guide may be useful. <p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <a name="license"><b>What exactly was the license terms for GDAL?</b></a><p>

The following terms are the same as X windows is released under, and is
generally known as the "MIT License".  It is intended to give you permission
to do whatever you want with the GDAL source, including building propietary
commercial software, without further permission from me, or requirement to
distribute your source code.  A few portions of GDAL under under slightly
different terms.  For instance the libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, and libgeotiff 
license terms may vary slightly though I don't think any of them differ
in any significant way.  Some external libraries which can be optionally
used by GDAL are under radically different licenses.<p>

<li> <b>What are ``Well Known Text'' projections, and how do I use them?</b><p>

OpenGIS's <i>Well Known Text</i> is a textual format for defining coordinate
systems.  It is loosely based on the EPSG coordinate systems model.  While
GDAL itself just passes these definitions around as text strings, there is
also an OGRSpatialReference class in gdal/ogr for manipulating them and
a linkage to <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj">PROJ.4</a> for 
transforming between coordinate systems.  The
OGRSpatialReference, and PROJ.4 linkaged (but not PROJ.4 itself) is
linked into the GDAL shared library by default.  More documentation on WKT
and OGRSpatialReference can be found in the 
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/opengis/ogrhtml/osr_tutorial.html">
OGR Projections Tutorial</a>.<p>


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>Can I reproject rasters with GDAL?</b><p>

Yes, you can use the <a href="gdal_utilities.html#gdalwarp">gdalwarp</a> 
utility program or programmatically use the GDALWarpOperation class described
in the <a href="warptut.html">Warp API Tutorial</a>.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>Why won't gdalwarp or gdal_merge write to most formats?</b><p>

GDAL supports many raster formats for reading, but significantly less formats
for writing.  Of the ones supported for writing most are only supported in
<i>create copy</i> mode.  Essentially this means they have to be written
sequentially from a provided input copy of the image to be written.  
Programs like gdal_merge.py or gdalwarp that write chunks of imagery 
non-sequentially cannot easily write to these sequential write formats. 
Generally speaking formats that are compressed, such as PNG, JPEG and GIF
are sequential write.  Also some formats require information such as the
coordinate system and color table to be known at creation time and so these
are also sequential write formats.<p>

When you encounter this problem it is generally a good idea to first write
the result to GeoTIFF format, and then translate to the desired target
format.<p>

To determine which formats support which capabilities, use the --formats
switch with pretty much any GDAL utility.  Each driver will include either
<b>rw</b> (read-only), <b>rw</b> (read or sequential write) or <b>rw+</b>
(read, sequential write or random write).<p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>Is the GDAL library thread-safe?</b><p>

No, GDAL is not completely thread safe.  

However for GDAL 1.3.0 much work has been done on making some common
scenarios thread safe.  In particular for the situation where many
threads are reading from GDAL datasets at once should work as long as
no two threads access the same GDALDataset object at the same time.  
However, in this scenario, no threads can be writing to GDAL while others
are reading or chaos may ensue. 

Also, while the GDAL core infrastructure is now thread-safe for this specific
case, only a few drivers have been vetted to be thread safe.  

It is intended that work will continue on improving GDAL's thread safety
in future versions.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>Does GDAL work in different international numeric locales?</b><p>

No.  GDAL makes extensive use of sprintf() and atof() internally to translate
numeric values.  If a locale is in effect that modifies formatting of 
numbers, altering the role of commas and periods in numbers, then PROJ.4
will not work.  This problem is common in some European locales.

On unix-like platforms, this problem can be avoided by forcing the use
of the default numeric locale by setting the LC_NUMERIC environment variable
to C.

eg.
<pre>
$ export LC_NUMERIC=C
$ gdalinfo abc.tif
</pre>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>How do I "debug" GDAL?</b><p>

Various helpful debugging information will be produced by GDAL and OGR if
the CPL_DEBUG environment variable is set to the value ON.  Review the 
documentation for the CPLDebug() function for more information on built-in
debugging messages.

On Unix operating systems GDAL can be built with the CFG environment variable
set to "debug" to enable debugger support with the -g compiler switch.  On
Windows edit the nmake.opt and ensure /Zi appears in the OPTFLAGS variable.
