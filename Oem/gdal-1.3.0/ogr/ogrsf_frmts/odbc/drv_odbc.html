<h1>ODBC RDBMS</h1>

OGR optionally supports spatial and non-spatial tables accessed via ODBC. 
ODBC is a generic access layer for access to many database systems, and
data that can be represented as a database (collection of tables). ODBC
support is potentially available on Unix and Windows platforms, but is
only included in unix builds by special configuration options.<p>

ODBC datasources are accessed using a datasource name of the form
<b>ODBC:<i>userid</i>/<i>password</i>@<i>dsn</i>,<i>table_list</i></b>.
With optional items dropped the following are also acceptable:

<ul>
<li> <b>ODBC:<i>userid</i>/<i>password</i>@<i>dsn</i></b>
<li> <b>ODBC:<i>userid</i>@<i>dsn</i>,<i>table_list</i></b>
<li> <b>ODBC:<i>dsn</i>,<i>table_list</i></b>
<li> <b>ODBC:<i>dsn</i></b>
</ul>

The <b><i>dsn</i></b> is the ODBC Data Source Name.  Normally ODBC datasources
are setup using an ODBC Administration tool, and assigned a DSN.  That DSN
is what is used to access the datasource.<p>

By default the ODBC searches for GEOMETRY_COLUMNS table.  If found it is
used to identify the set of spatial tables that should be treated as layers
by OGR.  If not found, then all tables in the datasource are returned as
non-spatial layers.  However, if a table list (a list of comma seperated table
names) is provided, then only those tables will be represented as layers
(non-spatial).  Fetching the full definition of all tables in a complicated
database can be quite timeconsuming, so the ability to restrict the set of
tables accessed is primarily a performance issue.<p>

If the GEOMETRY_COLUMNS table is found, it is used to select a column to 
be the geometry source.  However, it is currently a hardcoded assumption
that the geometry is in WKT format.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

Currently the ODBC OGR driver is read-only, so new features, tables and
datasources cannot normally be created by OGR applications.  This limitation
may be removed in the future. <p>
