<h1>MySQL</h1>

This driver implements read-only access for non-spatial data in 
<a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> tables.  <p>

When opening a database, it's name should be specified in the form
"MYSQL:<dbname>[,options]" where the options can include comma seperated
items like "user=*userid*", "password=*password*", "host=*host*" and 
"port=*port*".<p>

As well, a "tables=*table*;*table*..." option can be
added to restrict access to a specific list of tables in the database.  This
option is primarily useful when a database has alot of tables, and scanning
all their schemas would take a significant amount of time. <p>

Currently all regular user tables are assumed to be layers from an OGR
point of view, with the table names as the layer names.  Named views are
not currently support.<p>

If a single integer field is a primary key, it will be used as the FID 
otherwise the FID will be assigned sequentially, and fetches by FID will
be extremely slow. <p>

The following example datasource name opens the database schema 
<i>westholland</i> with password <i>psv9570</i> for userid <i>root</i>
on the port <i>3306</i>.  No hostname is provided, so localhost is assumed.
The tables= directive means that only the bedrijven table is scanned and
presented as a layer for use.<p>

<pre>
MYSQL:westholland,user=root,password=psv9570,port=3306,tables=bedrijven
