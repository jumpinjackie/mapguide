simple value -> schema primitive datatypes

check 7 node kinds

changes to context

static type checking???

- the XPathNSResolver is now the Static Context; it has more informations 
than the simple list of available namespaces, e.g. default namespace for 
functions, list of data types, base URI, collations
- the XPathExpression interface needs more than just the active DOM node to 
evaluate the expression; instead of building a simple Context object (with 
no variables) it should directly accept the Evaluation Context (that now 
holds also the current date and time)

In any case, I think that the XPath 1.0 interface needs a way for the user 
to force a specific Context object to be used both in the parsing and the 
evaluation of an XPath 1.0 query (to provide variables, but also to add 
custom functions), as the DOM3-XPath specs allow:

Issue XPath-39:
Support for custom variables and functions would be very useful.
Resolution: No change.
It is possible for an implementation to supply alternative sources of an 
XPathEvaluator that can be customized with a custom variable and function 
context. We do not specify how this is accomplished. It is too complex to 
address in this version of the XPath DOM.



type checking has changed, 2 levels now dependent on fallback conversions

assess changes to lexer and parser

namespace node changes - now dont have a parent and share

wildcard now *:foo as well as foo:*

we cant do this   child::school/(child::faculty | child::staff)/child::address    (ParenthesizedExpr)

derefernces   child::figref[1]/attribute::refid=>figure

Now use sequences
    intersect, union, except



[10]    NodeComp    ::=    Expr  ("==" |  "!==")  Expr
[11]    OrderComp    ::=    Expr  ("<<" |  ">>" |  "precedes" |  "follows")  Expr



quantified expressions - every $part in //part satisfies $part/@discounted



for expressions



datatypes





notes

check out 3-1 which should be a NCName
