--------------------------------------

Here's the stuff still on my TODO list:

       1. Make a test case for DB.join()

       Done - [ 2. Port dbtables.py and make a set of test cases ]
       (thanks Greg!)

       3. Double check all Reference Counting and malloc/free's
	  (ongoing...)

       4. Make concise doc-strings for all methods in the extension
          module that simply show method name and parameters.

       5. Switch all methods in the extension module to use keyword
          argument conventions for consistency.

       Done (#@!@#$) [6. Find out what's wrong with DBEnv.lock_put]

       Done - [ 7. Changes needed for BerkeleyDB 3.2 ]

       8. Implement lock_vec


Possible Future Enhancements:

    DBEnv Methods

        set_errcall(function) --
                Set function to be called when errors happen in the
                library.

        set_feedback(function) --
                Set callback function to be called periodically during
                long running operations.

        set_paniccall(function) --
                Set callback function to be called when DB_RUNRECOVERY
                is about to be returned from a Berkeley DB method.
