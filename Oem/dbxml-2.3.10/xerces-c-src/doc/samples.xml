<s1 title="&XercesCName; Samples">

    <s2 title="Introduction">
    <p>&XercesCName; comes packaged with sample applications that
    demonstrate salient features of the parser using simple
    applications written on top of the SAX and DOM APIs provided by
    the parser.  Sample XML data files are provided in the samples/data directory.</p>
    </s2>

    <s2 title="Building the Samples">
        <p>For general information related to building--including
        platform-specific information--please refer to the 
        <jump href="build.html">Build Page</jump>.  This
        information covers a standard installation where one
        has downloaded the entire Xerces-C binary distribution
        to a place on the filesystem to which one has write
        access.  Below, we cover what to do if Xerces-C has been
        preinstalled on a system into a directory to which one
        does not have write access, but compiling the samples is
        desired.</p>
        <p>
            In this situation, just do the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the entire contents of the
            <code>samples</code> directory into a directory named
            samples that you have write-access to;</li>
            <li>Set the <code>XERCESCOUT</code> environment
            variable to point to the directory that is the parent
            of the newly-created <code>samples</code>
            directory;</li>
            <li>Proceed as normal to compile the samples (not
            forgetting to set <code>XERCESCROOT</code> to point
            to the place on the file system where Xerces-C&apos;s
            include files etc. are to be found);</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>Once this is done, the compiled samples will be placed
        in a directory named <code>bin</code>; this directory
        will be located in the same directory as the
        <code>samples</code> directory created in step 1
        above.</p>
    </s2>

    <s2 title="Running the Samples">

    <p>The sample applications are dependent on the &XercesCName; shared library
		(and could also depend on the ICU library if you built &XercesCName; with ICU).
		Therefore, on Windows platforms you must make sure that your <code>PATH</code>
		environment variable is set properly to pick up these shared libraries at
		runtime.</p>

		<p>On UNIX platforms you must ensure that <ref>LIBPATH</ref>
		environment variable is set properly to pick up the shared libraries at
		runtime. (UNIX gurus will understand here that <ref>LIBPATH</ref> actually
		translates to <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> on Solaris and Linux, <em>SHLIB_PATH</em> on HP-UX,
		<em>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> on Mac OS X,
		and stays as <em>LIBPATH</em> on AIX).</p>

		<p>To set you LIBPATH (on AIX for example), you would type:</p>
<source>export LIBPATH=&XercesCInstallDir;/lib:$LIBPATH</source>

               <p>On both Windows and UNIX platforms, if the parser is built with icu message loader
               (like IBM XML4C binaries), or message catalog loader, then you need to set another environment
               variable, XERCESC_NLS_HOME to point to the directory, $XERCESCROOT/msg, where the message
               files reside.              
               </p>
<source>
set XERCESC_NLS_HOME=$XERCESCROOT\msg
or
export XERCESC_NLS_HOME=$XERCESCROOT/msg
or
setenv XERCESC_NLS_HOME=$XERCESCROOT/msg
</source>
               
               <p>Once you have set up the environment variables, you can run the
               samples by opening a command window (or your shell prompt for
               UNIX environments).</p>
