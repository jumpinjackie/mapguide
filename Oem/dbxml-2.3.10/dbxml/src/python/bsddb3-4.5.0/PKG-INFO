Description: This module provides a nearly complete wrapping
        of the Sleepycat C API for the Database
        Environment, Database, Cursor, and Transaction
        objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python
        type in the bsddb3.db module.  The databse objects
        can use various access methods: btree, hash, recno,
        and queue.  For the first time all of these are
        fully supported in the Python wrappers.  Please see
        the documents in the docs directory of the source
        distribution or at the website for more details on
        the types and methods provided.
