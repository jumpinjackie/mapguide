<!-- 
This file allows the ODBC Known Driver connection builder to load builders of known
ODBC drivers. Connection builders specified in this file must inherit from the 
Maestro.Editors.FeatureSource.Providers.Odbc.OdbcDriverInfo class

To create your own ODBC driver connection builder, extend the OdbcDriverInfo class. Define the
appropriate driver connection properties (control the PropertyGrid display using the
System.ComponentModel.DisplayNameAttribute and System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute) and
override the ToOdbcConnectionString() method to turn this into the matching ODBC connection string

Once that is done, register the fully-qualified type in this file and it will be picked up by
the connection builder.
