/**
\addtogroup Maps_and_Layers_Module

Maps and layers are fundamental components of the Geospatial Platform API. A map is
composed of layers, where each layer represents data from a single feature source.

A map (MgMap object) represents the run-time state of a map. A map is created from
a \ref MapDefinition_schema resource, which defines the initial state
of the map, including the layers and coordinate system used for the map. Layers can be 
added, deleted, and modified in the run-time state without altering the MapDefinition.



For additional information about manipulating and rendering maps,
see the \DevGuide.
