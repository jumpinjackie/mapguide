/**
\addtogroup drawing_source

<p>
A resource containing a \link DWF DWF \endlink. Drawing sources are
created by Autodesk Studio by loading a DWG or DWF file.
</p>
<p>
The Autodesk DWG file format is optimized for a CAD application not the web,
and hence is transformed in the load process. You have the choice of converting DWG to an SDF \link feature_source feature source \endlink
to allow for rule based stylization (theming) or to a DWF drawing
source to preserve visual fidelity.
